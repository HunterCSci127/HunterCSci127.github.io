<div>

<p>
Today's lab will focus on random numbers, indefinite loops, and more on command-line scripts.

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and Python IDLE programming
environment with the pandas, numpy, and folium package installed.

<h3>Random Range</h3>

Python has a built-in library for generating random numbers.  To use it, you include at the top of your file:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
import random
</pre>

The <tt>random</tt> library includes a function that's similar to <tt>range</tt>, called <tt>randrange</tt>.  As with <tt>range</tt>, you can specify the starting, stopping, and step values, and the function <tt>randrange</tt> chooses a number at random in that range.  Some examples:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(5)</tt> returns one of 0,1,2,3,4
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(1,10,2)</tt> returns one of 1,3,5,7,9
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(360)</tt> returns one of 0,1,2,...,359
</ul>

Let's use that last example to have our turtle make a random walk:
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/ab6cddc880" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Notice that our turtle turns <tt>a</tt> degrees, where <tt>a</tt> is chosen at random between 0 and 359 degrees.  What if your turtle was in a city and had to stay on a grid of streets (and not ramble through buildings)?  How can you change the <tt>randrange()</tt> to choose only from the numbers:  <tt>0,90,180,270</tt> (submit your answer as Problem #10).

</div>


<div>
<h3>Indefinite Loops</h3>

<p> We have been using <tt>for</tt>-loops to repeat tasks a fixed number of times (often called a <i>definite loop</i>).  There is another type of loop that repeats while a condition holds (called a <i>indefinite loop</i>).  The most common is a <tt>while</tt>-loop.
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
while condition:
   command1
   command2
   ...
   commandN
</pre>
While the <tt>condition</tt> is true, the block of commands nested under the while statement are repeated.

<p>For example, let's have a turtles continue their random walk as long as their x and y values are within 50 of the starting point (to keep them from wandering off the screen):

<p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/6738c47304" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> Indefinite loops are useful for simulations (like our simple random walk above) and checking input.  For example, the following code fragment:



<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
age = int(input('Please enter age: '))
while age < 0:
    print('Entered a negative number.')
    age = int(input('Please enter age: '))
print('You entered your age as:', age)
</pre>
will ask the user for their age, and continue asking until the number they entered is non-negative (<a href="http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=age%20%3D%20int%28input%28'Please%20enter%20age%3A%20'%29%29%0Awhile%20age%20%3C%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28'Entered%20a%20negative%20number.'%29%0A%20%20%20%20age%20%3D%20int%28input%28'Please%20enter%20age%3A%20'%29%29%0Aprint%28'You%20entered%20your%20age%20as%3A',%20age%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%22-3%22,%223%22%5D&textReferences=false">example in pythonTutor</a>).

<h3>More on Command Line Scripts</h3>

<p>
In <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>, we introduced the shell, or command line, commands to create new directories (folders) and how to list the contents of those folders (and expanded on this with relative paths in <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> and absolute paths in <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>).
In <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a>, we wrote a simple script that prints: <tt>Hello, World</tt>.  We can write scripts that take the shell commands we have learned and store them in a file to be used later.



<p>
It's a bit archaic, but we can create the file with the <tt>vi</tt> editor.   It
dates back to the early days of the Unix operating system.  It has the advantage that it's integrated into the Unix operating system and guaranteed to be there.  It is worth trying at least once (so if you're in a bind and need to edit Unix files remotely, you can), but if you hate it (which is likely), use the graphical <tt>gEdit</tt> (you can find it via the search icon on the left hand menu bar).

<p>
Let's create a simple shell script with <tt>vi</tt>:
<ol>
	<li> Open a terminal window.
	<li> Type in the terminal window:  <tt>vi setupProject</tt>
	<li> To add text to the file, begin by typing <tt>i</tt> (the letter i)
	which stands for "insert"
	<li> Type the lines:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
#Your name here
#October 2017
#Shell script:  creates directories for project
mkdir projectFiles
cd projectFiles
mkdir source
mkdir data
mkdir results
</pre>
	<li> Click on the ESC (escape key-- usually on the upper row of keys) which escapes from insert mode.
	<li> Type:  <tt>:wq</tt> which stands for "write my file" and "quit" (the ":" is necessary-- it tells vi that you want to use the menu commands).
	<li> This brings us back to the terminal window.
	Type <tt>ls</tt> to see a listing of the directory, which should include the file,
	<tt>setupProject</tt>, you just created.
	<li> Next, we'll change the permissions on the file, so that we can run it directly, by just typing its name:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
chmod +x setupProject
</pre>
	(changes the "mode" to be executable).

	<li> To run your shell script, you can now type its name at the terminal:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
./setupProject
</pre>
	<li> Check to see that your script works, type <tt>ls</tt> to see the new directories your script you created.

</ol>

<p> <b>Troubles with vi?</b>  It's not intuitive-- here's more on vi:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/tutorials/l-vi/index.html">IBM tutorial for vi</a>
	<li> <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/UnixAndC/Editors/ViIntro.html">UC Davis 5-minute Tutorial</a>
	<li> <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheetvi.php">Ryan's Tutorial vi cheat sheet</a>

</ul>
If you hate <tt>vi</tt>, just edit using <tt>gEdit</tt> (the Linux version of TextEdit) or IDLE.

<p>When done, see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
