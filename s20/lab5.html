<h3>Pandas & Reading Data</h3>

<img src="pandas_logo.png" width="80%">

<p>
To make reading files easier, we will use the Pandas library that lets you read in structured data files very efficiently.  <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a>, Python Data Analysis Library, is an elegant, open-source package for extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data, especially those stored in 2D arrays (like spreadsheets).  It incorporates most of the Python constructs and libraries that we have seen thus far.

<p>(Pandas is installed on all the lab machines.  If you are using your own machine, see the directions at the end of <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for installing packages for Python.)
<!--
<p>[Pandas is installed on all the lab machines.  If you are using your own machine, you should check that it is there by typing at the Python shell (in IDLE, spyder, or your favorite Python interface):
<pre>
	import pandas as pd
</pre>

<p>If you get an error that the library is not found.  Open up a terminal, and use conda to install it:
<pre>
	conda install pandas
</pre>
If you are not using anaconda, see the directions at the end of <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>].
-->

<p>
In Pandas, the basic structure is a <tt>DataFrame</tt>
which stored data in rectangular grids.
Let's use this to visualize the change in New York City's population.  First, start your file with an import statements for pyplot and pandas:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
</pre>

We used <tt>matplotlib</tt> in the <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a> and <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> for plotting.  The <tt>as plt</tt> allows us to use
the plotting commands without having to write <tt>matplotlib.pyplot</tt> everytime, instead we just write <tt>plt</tt>.  Similarly,
The <tt>as pd</tt> allows us to use pandas commands without writing out <tt>pandas</tt> everytime-- we just write <tt>pd</tt>.

<p>
Next, save the <a href="../f17/nycHistPop.csv">NYC historical population data</a> to the same directory as your program.
This is a "<i>comma separated values</i>" file-- which is a plain text file containing spreadsheet data, with commas separating the different columns (thus, the name).
Here's the first 10 lines of the file:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:600px">
Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City,,,,,,
* All population figures are consistent with present-day boundaries.,,,,,,
First census after the consolidation of the five boroughs,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Year,Manhattan,Brooklyn,Queens,Bronx,Staten Island,Total
1698,4937,2017,,,727,7681
1771,21863,3623,,,2847,28423
1790,33131,4549,6159,1781,3827,49447
1800,60515,5740,6642,1755,4563,79215
</pre>
Note that it has 5 extra lines at the top before the column names occur.  The pandas function for reading in CSV files is <tt>read_csv()</tt>.  It has an option to skip rows which we will use here:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)
</pre>

<p>
Before going on, let's print out the variable <tt>pop</tt>.  It is a dataframe, described in the reading above:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
print(pop)
</pre>

The last line of our first pandas program is:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
pop.plot(x="Year")
</pre>

which makes a graphical display of all of the data series in the variable <tt>pop</tt> with the series corresponding to the column "Year" as the x-axis.  Your output should look something like:
<p>
<img src="../f17/nycHist.png" height = 400>

<p>
To recap:  our program is:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import pandas as pd
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)
pop.plot(x="Year")

plt.show()

</pre>


which did the following:
<ul>
	<li> Imported the pandas library that contains structures and functions for organizing and visualizing data.  We also imported the pyplot library which pandas uses to create figures.
	<li> It read in a CSV file, containing NYC population historical data.
	<li> It displayed the data as a visual plot of years versus borough populations.
	<li> The last line shows the figure you created in a separate graphics window.
</ul>

There are useful built-in statistics functions for the dataframes in pandas.  For example, if you would like to know the maximum value for the series "Bronx", you apply the <tt>max()</tt> function to that series:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:575px">
print("The largest number living in the Bronx is", pop["Bronx"].max())
</pre>

Similarly the average (mean) population for Queens can be computed:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:575px">
print("The average number living in the Queens is", pop["Queens"].mean())
</pre>

<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
	<li> What happens if you leave off the <tt>x = "Year"</tt>?  Why?
	<li> What happens if you add in <tt>x = "Year", y = "Bronx"</tt>?
	<li> What do the series functions:  <tt>min()</tt>, <tt>std()</tt>, and
	<tt>count()</tt> do?
</ul>


</div>

<div>
<h3>Manipulating Columns</h3>

<p>
Each column in the original spreadsheet is a column, or <tt>series</tt>.  We can look at the column for the Bronx with:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    print(pop['Bronx'])
</pre>

How would you look at the one for Brooklyn?

<p>
A nice thing about series is that you can do basic arithmetic with them.  For example,
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    print(pop['Bronx']*2)
</pre>
prints out double the values in the column.

<p>You can also use multiple columns in a calculation:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    print(pop['Bronx']/pop['Total'])
</pre>
prints out the fraction of the total population that lives in the Bronx.
<p>
We can save that series by creating a new column for it:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    pop['Fraction'] = pop['Bronx']/pop['Total']
</pre>
and then can use it to create a new graph:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    pop.plot(x = 'Year', y = 'Fraction')
</pre>
We can save it to a file, by storing the current figure (via "get current figure" or <tt>gcf()</tt> function and then saving it:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    fig = plt.gcf()
    fig.savefig('fractionBX.png')
</pre>

shown in the following plot:
<p>
<img src="../f17/bronxFraction.png" height = 400>

<p>
Putting this altogether, we have a program:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:650px">
#Libraries for plotting and data processing:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

#Open the CSV file and store in pop
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)

#Compute the fraction of the population in the Bronx, and save as new column:
pop['Fraction'] = pop['Bronx']/pop['Total']

#Create a plot of year versus fraction of pop. in Bronx (with labels):
pop.plot(x = 'Year', y = 'Fraction')

#Save to the file:  fractionBX.png
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.savefig('fractionBX.png)
</pre>

<p>
How can you modify the program to let the user specify the borough to compute the fraction of the population?  When you have the answer, see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<h3> More on the Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>You can write programs in the Unix shell scripting language.  Often called <i>scripts</i>, they are typically used for tying together input and output from different programs.

<p> Let's look at a sample script (from <a href="https://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/bash-tute.html">elf lord's tutorials on linux</a>):

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
#!/bin/bash
echo "hello, $USER. I wish to list some files of yours"
echo "listing files in the current directory, $PWD"
ls  # list files
</pre>

Looking at this script line-by-line:
<ul>
	<li>
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
#!/bin/bash
</pre>

<p>  It's standard to include as the first line of your scripts that specifies the program that's running (this is often called the "shebang" line).  There's different variants of shell scripts.  We're using the default for Ubuntu (the type of Unix running on the lab laptops) called <tt>bash</tt>, so, we start our script by specifying that we want to use the <tt>bash</tt> shell to evaluate it.

	<li> The command <tt>echo</tt> is similar to <tt>print()</tt> in Python.  It
		writes a message to the terminal:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
echo "hello, $USER. I wish to list some files of yours"
echo "listing files in the current directory, $PWD"
</pre>

		<p> <tt>$USER</tt> is a built-in variable that store the name of the current user.  Similarly, the built-in variable, <tt>$PWD</tt>, stores the current directory (folder) that you are in.

	<li> Lastly, our scripts can include any of the Unix commands that you have already learned.  The last line of this file lists the files in the current directory using the <tt>ls</tt> command:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
ls  # list files
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
In the shell, the different types of quotes have similar, but different, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Double-Quotes.html">meanings</a>.  We'll use the double quotes since strings in double quotes will have special characters (like <tt>\n</tt> for newline) interpreted as in Python and C++.

<p> Use <tt>gEdit</tt> (you can launch it from the menu bar or by typing <tt>gedit</tt> at a terminal window) to modify the above script to say "Hello, World".  Note that we're leaving off the "!" since it is a bit confusing to print due to its special meaning in the shell (it lists the history, or previous commands, you have typed; for example: <tt>!!</tt> gives all commands in the history, <tt>!cd</tt> will repeat the most recent command you gave that starts with <tt>cd</tt>).  Include in the second and third lines your name and email for the grading scripts (the first line should be the <tt>#!/bin/bash</tt>

<p>Next, we'll change the permissions on the file, so that we can run it directly, by just typing its name:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
$ chmod +x helloScript
</pre>
	(changes the "mode" of the file <tt>helloScript</tt> to be executable-- if you name it something else, replace the name in <tt>chmod</tt> command above).

	<li> To run your first shell script, you can now type its name at the terminal:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
$ ./helloScript
</pre>


<p>Make sure to include a comment on the <b>second line</b> with your name (the first line has the <tt>#!</tt> line).  Comments in shell are, like Python, preceded by a <tt>#</tt>.

<p> Once you have a shell script that will print <tt>Hello, World</tt>, see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<div>
<h3>github</h3>

<a href="https://github.com"><img height=150 src="../s18/Octocat.png"></a>

<a href="https://github.com">github</a> is the standard way to share and collaborate on code.  It functions much as Google docs does for documents.
We will use it as a place (<b>repository</b> or "repo") for programs and lab exercises.

<ol>
	<li> If you do not already have an account, create an account on <a href="https://github.com">github</a>.  <tt>github</tt> will be used in future classes (and by employers), so, choose an account name that you can use for years to come.
	<li> Work through the <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1">github for beginners</a> tutorial.
	<li> Work through the
		<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">github Hello World</a> tutorial.
</ol>

<p> From Program #30 onward, all sample programs are available at the class
repository (repo):
<blockquote>
	<a href="https://github.com/stjohn/csci127">
	https://github.com/stjohn/csci127</a>
</blockquote>
You can access programs by going to the website, or, using the command line (see <a href="lab8.html">Lab 8</a> for details).
