Augmenting the material covered in the regular course, the honors section introduce additional tools for acquiring, analyzing, and visualizing data from publicly available sources.  To focus the inquiry, students will use the NYC OpenData to explore a self-chosen topic about the forces that shape the physical and social dynamics of New York City.    Students will present their analysis and visualization, employing multiple data sources and techniques, during a showcase at the end of the course.
