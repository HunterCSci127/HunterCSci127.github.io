<h3>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h3>
</div>


<div>
<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>  <b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i>
This course presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on problem-solving and computational thinking through 'coding': computer programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS minor. MATH 12500 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-req for intended Majors.

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from 
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and lab.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.
Programs are submitted via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>.
You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores).
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>In-Class Quizzes:</b> At every recitation, there will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory 
exercises.  
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> All quizzes must be taken during class time, and <b>there are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, we will drop up to two missed quizzes
	(if you take all quizzes, we will drop the lowest two scores).
	<li> The top 12 (out of 14 possible) quiz scores will count towards the quiz score in the final grade.  If you do better on the final examination than on the top 12 quizzes, we will replace up to 5 quizzes with your final exam grade.  
	<li> All computer-based quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell and C++ programming environment.
	<li> If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.
	<li> As suggested by the name, only in-class quizzes taken in class. Quizzes taken outside of class will be sanctioned with a grade of 0 and reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Repeated quizzes taken outside of class will result in a failing grade as well as sanctions, as outlined in the  Academic Integrity Policy.
	<!--
	<li> The programming quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and many programming job interviews).  For these, you may
	<b>not</b> use your notes, books, or computer. -->
		</ul>
</ul>

<!--
<p><b>Exit Slips:</b> At the end of each lecture, there will be exit slips submitted.
 
<ul>
	<li> The exit slips cover group work during class as well as comprehension of concepts for the day.  
	<li> <b>There are no make-up exit slips.</b>  Instead, we will drop up to two missed exit slips.
</ul>
-->

<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  Sample exams will be available on the course webpage.

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 30% </li>
      <li>Quizzes: 		30% </li>
      <!--
      <li>Exit Slips: 	10%	</li>  -->
      <li>Final Exam: 	40% </li>      
    </ul>
  </li>

	<p> 
	You must take and pass the final to pass the course.

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p>This is a <i>zero cost course</i>.  All course materials are freely available to enrolled students.

<p><b>Textbook & Readings:</b> The following is required for the course:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Python 3)</a> (free on-line textbook).  
</ul>
Additional readings and tutorials are available on the course webpage.

<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses multiple software tools and languages.  All are available on the lab computers.  
<ul>
	<li> Python:  a programming language that is freely available across multiple platforms.  See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on obtaining it for your home computer.
	<li> Unix:  an operating system that underlies Ubuntu Linux (what the lab computers run) as well as MacIntosh OSX.
	<li> Blackboard:  the learning management system used throughout CUNY.  Accounts are provided automatically to all enrolled students.  In this course, in-class quizzes will be given via Blackboard.
	<li> Gradescope:  an automatic grading program from UC Berkeley.  All programming assignments will be submitted to gradescope. An email with access information will be sent to your email of record at CUNYFirst two days before the semester starts.
	<li> Github: a freely available site for hosting and collaborating, particularly for programming.  
	<li> C++: a programming language that is freely available.  We will use it
	in the last third of the course.  Information on downloading it for your computer will be available in Lab 12. 
</ul>

<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
