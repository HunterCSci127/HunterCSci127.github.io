<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>A sequence of characters (i.e. letters, numbers, symbols) is called a <tt>string</tt>.  To indicate a string, we use quotes (either single or double, just as long as they match up) to indicate the start and end (a fancier way to say that is:  quotes deliminate the string).  For example, for our first program, we wrote:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
print("Hello, World!")
</pre>
<p>
The string, or sequence of characters, <tt>Hello, World!</tt>, was printed to the screen.  We can also store strings to be used again in the program.  For example, 
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(greeting)
</pre>
<p>
creates a location in memory that can be accessed by typing the name (or identifier) that we chose:  <tt>greeting</tt>.  <tt>greeting</tt> stores the string <tt>Hello, World!</tt>.  While the quotes are not stored, we will often write <tt>"Hello, World!"</tt> to make it more clear where the string begins and ends.  When we execute the code above, it will create the variable, <tt>greeting</tt>, and then print out the message:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Hello, World!
</pre>

<p>We can use the variable any number of times.  For example, if we wanted to print the message twice, we could use:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(greeting)
print(greeting)
</pre>

<h4>More Useful String Methods</h4>

<p> Since strings are used everywhere, there are many built-in functions for strings.
<ul>
	<li> Guess which each does from its name, then 
	<li> Click the forward button in the code window below to see if you guess was correct.
</ul>

<iframe width="800" height="400" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=greeting%20%3D%20%22Hello,%20World!%22%0A%0A%23Guess%20what%20the%20following%20string%20methods%20do%3A%0A%23%20%20Then%20click%20the%20forward%20button%20to%20see%20how%20you%20did%0A%0Aprint%28greeting.upper%28%29%29%0Aprint%28greeting.lower%28%29%29%0Aprint%28len%28greeting%29%29%0Aprint%28greeting.count%28'o'%29%29%0Aprint%28greeting.count%28'%20'%29%29%0Aprint%28greeting.find%28'll'%29%29%0A&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>


<p> For historic reasons, we start counting at 0, instead of 1, in many computer languages, including Python.  The <tt>find()</tt> command gives the location of <tt>"ll"</tt> which is 2 if you start by counting the first character as 0.


<h4>Looping Through Strings</h4>


<p> You can also loop through strings.  Try running the code below:

<p>
<iframe width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=myString%20%3D%20%22I%20love%20Python!!%22%0A%0Aprint%28myString%29%0A%0Afor%20c%20in%20myString%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28c%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

<p> Each character has a number assigned to it.  When you write a character, it is converted to its number, and that is stored instead to save space.  Python uses the standard Unicode encoding (which extends the popular ASCII encoding to new symbols and alphabets).  For example, <tt>ord('a')</tt> give the Unicode number for the character, <tt>a</tt>, which is 97.  
<p>Let's look at the Unicode of the characters in our string:

<p>
<iframe width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=myString%20%3D%20%22I%20love%20Python!!%22%0A%0Aprint%28myString%29%0A%0Afor%20c%20in%20myString%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28c,%20ord%28c%29%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

<p>To go the other direction, there's a function <tt>chr()</tt> which takes numbers and returns the corresponding character.  For example, <tt>chr(97)</tt> returns <tt>'a'</tt>.  Let's look at the characters with unicode from 65 to 69:

<p>
<iframe width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=%0Afor%20i%20in%20range%2865,70%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28i,%20chr%28i%29%29%0A%20%20%20%20%0Aprint%28%22That's%20it%20for%20now!%22%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

<p>The <tt>range()</tt> statement has several different options:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>range(stop)</tt>:  if you have only a single number in the 		parenthesis, it will generate all the numbers from 0 to <tt>stop - 1</tt>.  For example, <tt>range(5)</tt> generates the numbers <tt>0, 1, 2, 3, 4</tt>.
	
	<li> <tt>range(start, stop)</tt>:  if you have only two numbers in the parenthesis, it will generate all the numbers from start to <tt>stop - 1</tt>.  For example, <tt>range(65,70)</tt> generates the numbers <tt>65, 66, 67, 68, 690</tt>	.
	
	<li> <tt>range(start, stop, step)</tt>:  if you have three numbers in the parenthesis, it will generate all the numbers from start to <tt>stop - 1</tt>, increasing by <tt>step</tt> each time.  For example, <tt>range(100,200,10)</tt> generates the numbers <tt>100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190</tt>.
</ul>

<h3>Getting Input</h3>

<p>Last week, we used the <tt>print()</tt> function to write messages to the user of our program.  This week, we introduce, <tt>input()</tt>, to get information from the user.  Here's the basic format:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
aString = input("Put a message here to show user: ")
</pre>
where the string <tt>"Put a message..."</tt> is replaced by the prompt you would like the user to see and <tt>aString</tt> with the name of the string you are using in your program.

<p> <iframe width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=mess%20%3D%20input%28'Please%20enter%20a%20message%3A%20'%29%0Aprint%28%22You%20entered%22,%20mess%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%22hi%20mom%22%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

<h3>Biomolecular Sequences</h3>

<p> Let's apply what we just learned to some questions from biology.  DNA is a molecule that contains instructions for the cell (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">wiki</a>).  We can represent it as a string of four characters:  <tt>'A'</tt>, <tt>'C'</tt>, <tt>'G'</tt>, and <tt>'T'</tt> corresponding to the four nucleotides that are the building blocks for the sequences.  For example, 
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;">
insulin = "AGCCCTCCAGGACAGGCTGCATCAGAAGAGGCCATCAAGCAGGTCTGTTCCAAGGGCCTTTGCGTCAGGTGGGCTCAGGATTCCAGGGTGGCTGGACCCCAGGCCCCAGCTCTGCAGCAGGGAGGACGTGGCTGGGCTCGTGAAGCATGTGGGGGTGAGCCCAGGGGCCCCAAGGCAGGGCACCTGGCCTTCAGCCTGCCTCAGCCCTGC"
</pre>
is the start of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=3630">DNA sequence for insulin in humans</a>.

<p>We have the tools to compute how long the out sequence is as well as GC-content (the fraction of the sequence that is C and G) which is correlated with the stability of the molecule:
<ul>
	<li> First, we compute the length of the sequence.
	<li> Next, we count the number of <tt>'C'</tt> and number of <tt>'G'</tt>.
	<li> Next, we add the number of <tt>'C'</tt> and number of <tt>'G'</tt> together, and divide by the length.
	<li> Then, we convert to a percentage by multiplying by 100 and print out the answer.
</ul>

<h3>Acronyms</h3>

<p>
It is often quite useful to break a string into pieces, and work with those pieces, instead of the whole string.  Below is a simple example that foreshadows later programs that we will write for real data sets.

<p> We will write a program that takes a phrase and creates an acronym of the phrase:  that is, the first letter of each word.  

<p>Let's break this into steps:
<ol>
	<li> Prompt for a phrase & read it in. 
	<li> Make the prhase upper case.
	<li> Split up the phrase into words. 
	<li> Take the first letter of each work split (after split, print out each part, show as a list), concatendation, and make an acronym of it (turn in as program)

<pre>
Enter a phrase:  City University New York
Your phrase in capital letters:  CITY UNIVERSITY NEW YORK
Acronym:  CUNY
</pre>

</div>



<h3>Natural Language Program?</h3>

<p>  Something that works with strings and patterns in language (maybe just focus on generation) and leads into the mad lib from Colgate (give as the homework).

<p> Compute percentage of vowels-- similar to computing CG content in biology
queuing


<p>From http://cs.colgate.edu/~mhay/cosc101sp15/hw/02/hw2.pdf:
<pre>
Program 1: Mad libs
Write a short program that asks for a noun (string) and two verbs (both strings). (You can assume that both verbs are in third person form.) Using the three inputs, your program should print the sentence:
If it <verb 1> like a <noun> and <verb 2> like a <noun>, it probably is a <noun>.
Below is an example execution of the program where the user types “duck,” “walks”, and “talks.”:
What s the noun? duck
What s the first verb? walks
What s the second verb? talks
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it probably is a duck.
A second example where the user types “loon,” “swims,” and “dives.”: 1
What s the noun? loon
What s the first verb? swims
What s the second verb? dives
If it swims like a loon and dives like a loon, it probably is a loon.
</pre>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Looping Through Strings, Revisited</h3>

<p>There's another way we can loop through strings, using the index of each character.  Let's assume that we have:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
greeting = "Hello, World!"
</pre>
Before, we printed out the whole string with:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
print(greeting)
</pre>
If we wanted to print out only the first letter, we could write:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
print(greeting[0])
</pre>
where the number between the square brackets is the index of the character, in this case, 0, or the very first character of the string.  

<p>Try guessing what the following code does and then running it:

<p>
