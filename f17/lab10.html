<h2>Lab 10<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will focus on mapping data, using pandas, numpy, and folium.  

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and Python IDLE programming 
environment with the pandas, numpy, and folium package installed.

<h3>Random Range</h3>

Python has a built-in library for generating random numbers.  To use it, you include at the top of your file:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
import random
</pre>

The <tt>random</tt> library includes a function that's similar to <tt>range</tt>, called <tt>randrange</tt>.  As with <tt>range</tt>, you can specify the starting, stopping, and step values, and the function <tt>randrange</tt> chooses a number at random in that range.  Some examples:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(5)</tt> returns one of 0,1,2,3,4
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(1,10,2)</tt> returns one of 1,3,5,7,9
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(360)</tt> returns one of 0,1,2,...,359
</ul>

Let's use that last example to have our turtle make a random walk:
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/ab6cddc880" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Notice that our turtle turns <tt>a</tt> degrees, where <tt>a</tt> is chosen at random between 0 and 359 degrees.  What if your turtle was in a city and had to stay on a grid of streets (and not ramble through buildings)?  How can you change the <tt>randrange()</tt> to choose only from the numbers:  <tt>0,90,180,270</tt> (submit your answer as Problem #10).

</div>


<div>
<h3>Indefinite Loops</h3>

<p> We have been using <tt>for</tt>-loops to repeat tasks a fixed number of times (often called a <i>definite loop</i>).  There is another type of loop that repeats while a condition holds (called a <i>indefinite loop</i>).  The most common is a <tt>while</tt>-loop.  
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
while condition:
   command1
   command2
   ...
   commandN
</pre>
While the <tt>condition</tt> is true, the block of commands nested under the while statement are repeated.

<p>For example, let's have a turtles continue their random walk as long as their x and y values are within 50 of the starting point (to keep them from wandering off the screen):

<p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/6738c47304" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> Indefinite loops are useful for simulations (like our simple random walk above) and checking input.  For example, the following code fragment:



<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
age = int(input('Please enter age: '))
while age < 0:
    print('Entered a negative number.')
    age = int(input('Please enter age: '))
print('You entered your age as:', age)
</pre>
will ask the user for their age, and continue asking until the number they entered is non-negative (<a href="http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=age%20%3D%20int%28input%28'Please%20enter%20age%3A%20'%29%29%0Awhile%20age%20%3C%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28'Entered%20a%20negative%20number.'%29%0A%20%20%20%20age%20%3D%20int%28input%28'Please%20enter%20age%3A%20'%29%29%0Aprint%28'You%20entered%20your%20age%20as%3A',%20age%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%22-3%22,%223%22%5D&textReferences=false">example in pythonTutor</a>).

<h3>Finding Errors</h3>

Finding, and fixing errors, in your programs is a very useful skill.  Let's look at a program with lots of errors and work through how to identify the issues and fix them.  If you cloned the repo above, you will have a copy of <a href="https://github.com/stjohn/csci127/blob/master/errors.py">errors.py</a> on your computer (you can also download from the webpage).  When loaded into IDLE, it does not run:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:650px"># errors.py is based on dateconvert2.py from Chapter 5 of the Zelle textbook
#     Converts day month and year numbers into two date formats

def main()
    # get the day month and year
    day, month year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")

    date1 = str(month)"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", 
              "May", "June", "July", "August", 
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[-1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)

    print("The date is" date1, "or", date2+".")

main()
</pre>
Instead, a dialog box pops up and says "invalid syntax":<br>
<br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow1.jpg">
<br>

<p>The red line indicates where the intepreter has found an error.  Can you tell what it is?  Syntax is another word for grammar, so, it most likely missing `punctuation' or a misspelling of some sort.  We have spelled <tt>def</tt> correctly and have the right number of parenthesis, so, what else is missing?

<p>The answer is after the parenthesis on a function definition, a colon is required.  Add that in:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    def main():
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow2.jpg"><br>
<br>Instead of the whole line being highlighted, only the word <tt>year</tt> is.  The Python intepreter was not expecting <tt>year</tt> and says there is a grammatical mistake.  Since <tt>year</tt> does not include any grammatical constructs, we need to look <i>before</i> the message to see where the error is.  
Do you see it?

<p>The answer is lists of variables need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    day, month, year = ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Once more we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow3.jpg"><br>

<p>It has highlighted the first item, <tt>date1</tt> on the line.  That is a name and looks fine.  So, as above, let's look before the highlighted error to see if there's a problem.  The line above it is:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    day, month, year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")
</pre>
It did not highlight this line, so, the problem must be at the end.  Do you see it?  

<p>The answer is we are missing a closing parenthesis.  The line has two left parenthesis but only one right parenthesis.  Add the right parenthesis in:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    ... and year numbers: "))
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow4.jpg"><br>

<p>The intepreter does not understand the second " on the line.  Why?  What is this line doing?  It's constructing a string and storing it in the variable <tt>date1</tt>.  How do you build a string out of smaller strings?

<p>The answer is to put smaller strings together (called concatenation) we need to use the plus sign (+).  The line is missing a plus sign right before the quotes.  Add the plus sign in:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    date1 = str(month) + "/" ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box, but this one has a different message:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow5.jpg"><br>

<p><tt>EOL</tt> means "End of the line", so, the message says that the end of the line was reached before you finished defining the string.  How can you fix this?

<p>The answer is to end the string, using quotation marks.  The line is missing a quotation mark at the very end.  Add the quotation mark :
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    ...+ ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Our familiar dialog box returns:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow6.jpg"><br>

<p>We have seen this type of error before.  How do you fix it?

<p>The answer is lists of arguments need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    ... date is", date1 ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It runs!  Now let's make sure it works.  Type in at the prompt:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
</pre>
Uh oh, instead of output, we get the following messages:
<pre style = "color: red">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 18, in <module>
    main()
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 13, in main
    monthStr = months[month+1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
<p>When you see messages like this, go to the very last line:
<pre style = "color: red">
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
It says that the index for our list is out of range.  An index is the item of the list that we're accessing.  For example, <tt>months[1]</tt> has index <tt>1</tt> and will give us <tt>February</tt>.  The range of the index for a list is <tt>0</tt> to one less than the length of the list.  In the case of <tt>months</tt>, the range is <tt>[0,1,2,...,11]</tt>.  What went wrong when we entered <tt>12</tt> for our month?  


<p>The answer is we used <tt>month+1 = 12 + 1 = 13</tt> as the index:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    monthStr = months[month+1]
</pre>
which is out of range.  What do we want instead?  Instead of adding <tt>1</tt>, we should subtract <tt>1</tt>.  Change it in the program:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    monthStr = months[month-1]
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It still runs, but does it work?  Let's try the same input again:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
The date is 12/31/14 or December 31,  + str(year).
</pre>

<p>Something odd is happening at the end-- <tt>str(year)</tt> does not look right.  Let's look at the print statement:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
The intepreter is treating <tt>",  + str(year)"</tt> as a string (instead of evaluating <tt>str(year)</tt>), so, we must have put the quotation mark in the wrong place before.  Let's move it:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ","  + str(year)
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Success!  But try a few other inputs, just to make sure.  It is always good to try cases that are near the `boundary' of what's allowed, since those are the places we are most likely to make mistakes:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1,1,2015
The date is 1/1/2015 or January 1,2015.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1, 2, 2003
The date is 2/1/03 or February 1,2003.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 4, 7, 1976
The date is 7/4/1976 or July 4,1976.
</pre>

<p>We have removed all the errors, and the program now runs correctly!
