<h3>Exam Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The exam is closed book and closed notes. </li>
  <li> When taking the exam, you may have with you
    <ul>
      <li> pens or pencils </li>
      <li> a two-sided 8.5" x 11" page of notes. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> You may not use a computer or calculator. </li>
<!--  <li> All books and bags must be left at the front of the classroom
during this exam. This is to keep the aisles clear, so that the instructor can
easily reach people to answer questions. </li>-->
  <li> You must be enrolled in the course to take the exam. 
  <!--When you
enter the classroom, you will be given an exam. You may write your name
on the exam, but <font color="red">do not open it</font> until
instructed to do so. This is so everyone has the same amount of time to
complete the exam. --></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure you do all the problems that have been
assigned. The problems (or parts of them) make excellent exam
questions. </li>
  <li> Work through the sample and mock exams. These (or variations of them)
often appear on exams. </li>
  <li> While you can photocopy your one page of notes, preparing it by hand is
  an excellent way to study.  First, go through each problem and notes from each lecture, and make a list of the important concepts and ideas in each.  Then, consolidate your list to fit on a single sheet of paper.  Include standard formats or templates for coding constructs and design patterns, as well as samples of recurring themes.
