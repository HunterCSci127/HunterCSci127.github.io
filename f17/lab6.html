<h3>Pandas & Reading Data</h3>

<p>
To make reading files easier, we will use the Pandas library that lets you read in structured data files very efficiently.  <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a>, Python Data Analysis Library, is an elegant, open-source package for extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data, especially those stored in 2D arrays (like spreadsheets).  It incorporates most of the Python constructs and libraries that we have seen thus far.

<p>(Pandas is installed on all the lab machines.  If you are using your own machine, see the directions at the end of <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for installing packages for Python.)
<!--
<p>[Pandas is installed on all the lab machines.  If you are using your own machine, you should check that it is there by typing at the Python shell (in IDLE, spyder, or your favorite Python interface):
<pre>
	import pandas as pd
</pre>

<p>If you get an error that the library is not found.  Open up a terminal, and use conda to install it:
<pre>
	conda install pandas
</pre>
If you are not using anaconda, see the directions at the end of <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>].
-->

<p>
In Pandas, the basic structure is a <tt>DataFrame</tt>
which stored data in rectangular grids.
Let's use this to visualize the change in New York City's population.  First, start your file with an import statements for pyplot and pandas:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
</pre>

We used <tt>matplotlib</tt> in the <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a> and <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> for plotting.  The <tt>as plt</tt> allows us to use 
the plotting commands without having to write <tt>matplotlib.pyplot</tt> everytime, instead we just write <tt>plt</tt>.  Similarly, 
The <tt>as pd</tt> allows us to use pandas commands without writing out <tt>pandas</tt> everytime-- we just write <tt>pd</tt>.

<p>
Next, save the <a href="nycHistPop.csv">NYC historical population data</a> to the same directory as your program.  
This is a "comma separated values" file-- which is a plain text file containging spreadsheet data, with commas separating the different columns (thus, the name).
Here's the first 10 lines of the file:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:600px">
Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City,,,,,,
* All population figures are consistent with present-day boundaries.,,,,,,
First census after the consolidation of the five boroughs,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Year,Manhattan,Brooklyn,Queens,Bronx,Staten Island,Total
1698,4937,2017,,,727,7681
1771,21863,3623,,,2847,28423
1790,33131,4549,6159,1781,3827,49447
1800,60515,5740,6642,1755,4563,79215
</pre>
Note that it has 5 extra lines at the top before the column names occur.  The pandas function for reading in CSV files is <tt>read_csv()</tt>.  It has an option to skip rows which we will use here:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)
</pre>

<p>
Before going on, let's print out the variable <tt>pop</tt>.  <tt>pop</tt> is a dataframe, described in the reading above:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
print(pop)
</pre>

The last line of our first pandas program is:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
pop.plot(x="Year")
</pre>

which makes a graphical display of all of the data series in the variable <tt>pop</tt> with the series corresponding to the column "Year" as the x-axis.  Your output should look something like:
<p>
<img src="nycHist.png" height = 400>

<p>
To recap:  our program is:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import pandas as pd
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)
pop.plot(x="Year")

plt.show()

</pre>


which did the following:
<ul>
	<li> Imported the pandas library that contains structures and functions for organizing and visualizing data.  We also imported the pyplot library which pandas uses to create figures.
	<li> It read in a CSV file, containing NYC population historical data.
	<li> It displayed the data as a visual plot of years versus borough populations.
	<li> The last line shows the figure you created in a separate graphics window.
</ul>

There are useful built-in statistics functions for the dataframes in pandas.  For example, if you would like to know the maximum value for the series "Bronx", you apply the <tt>max()</tt> function to that series:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:575px">
print("The largest number living in the Bronx is", pop["Bronx"].max()) 
</pre>

Similarly the average (mean) population for Queens can be computed:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:575px">
print("The average number living in the Queens is", pop["Queens"].mean()) 
</pre>

<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
	<li> What happens if you leave off the <tt>x = "Year"</tt>?  Why?
	<li> What happens if you add in <tt>x = "Year", y = "Bronx"</tt>?
	<li> What does the series functions:  <tt>.min()</tt>, <tt>.std()</tt>, and 
	<tt>.count()</tt> do?  
</ul>


</div>

<div>
<h3>Manipulating Columns</h3>

<p>
Each column in the original spreadsheet is a column, or <tt>series</tt>.  We can look at the column for the Bronx with:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    print(pop['Bronx'])
</pre>

How would you look at the one for Brooklyn?

<p>
A nice thing about series is that you can do basic arithmetic with them.  For example, 
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    print(pop['Bronx']*2)
</pre>
prints out double the values in the column.

<p>You can also use multiple columns in a calculation:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    print(pop['Bronx']/pop['Total'])
</pre>
prints out the fraction of the total population that lives in the Bronx.
<p>
We can save that series by creating a new column for it:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    pop['Fraction'] = pop['Bronx']/pop['Total']
</pre>
and then can use it to create a new graph:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    pop.plot(x = 'Year', y = 'Fraction')
</pre>
We can save it to a file, by storing the current figure (via "get current figure" or gcf() function and then saving it:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
    fig = plt.gcf()
    fig.savefig('fractionBX.png')
</pre>

shown in the following plot:
<p>
<img src="bronxFraction.png" height = 400>

<p>
Putting this altogether, we have a program:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:650px">
#Libraries for plotting and data processing:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

#Open the CSV file and store in pop
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)

#Compute the fraction of the population in the Bronx, and save as new column:
pop['Fraction'] = pop['Bronx']/pop['Total']

#Create a plot of year versus fraction of pop. in Bronx (with labels):
pop.plot(x = 'Year', y = 'Fraction')

#Save to the file:  fractionBX.png
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.savefig('fractionBX.png)
</pre>

<p>
How can you modify the program to let the user specify the borough to compute the fraction of the population?  When you have the answer, see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<h3> More on the Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>
In <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>, we introduced the shell, or command line, commands to create new directories (folders) and how to list the contents of those folders (and expanded on this with relative paths in <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> and absolute paths in <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>).  We can take those commands and store them in a file to be used
later.

<p>
It's a bit archaic, but we can create the file with the <tt>vi</tt> editor.   It 
dates back to the early days of the Unix operating system.  It has the advantage that it's integrated into the operating system and guaranteed to be there.  It is worth trying at least once (so if you're in a bind and need to edit unix files remotely, you can), but if you hate it (which is likely), use the graphical <tt>gEdit</tt> (you can find it via the search icon on the left hand menu bar).

<p>
Let's create a simple shell script with <tt>vi</tt>:
<ol>
	<li> Open a terminal window.
	<li> Type in the terminal window:  <tt>vi setupProject</tt>
	<li> To add text to the file, begin by typing <tt>i</tt> (the letter i)
	which stands for "insert"
	<li> Type the lines:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
#Your name here
#October 2017
#First shell script:  creates directories for project
mkdir projectFiles
cd projectFiles
mkdir source
mkdir data
mkdir results
	</pre>
	<li> Click on the ESC (escape key-- usually on the upper row of keys) which escapes from insert mode.
	<li> Type:  <tt>:wq</tt> which stands for "write my file" and "quit" (the ":" is necessary-- it tells vi that you want to use the menu commands).
	<li> This brings us back to the terminal window.  
	Type <tt>ls</tt> to see a listing of the directory, which should include the file,
	<tt>setupProject</tt>, you just created.
	<li> Next, we'll change the permissions on the file, so that we can run it directly, by just typing its name:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
chmod +x setupProject
	</pre>
	(changes the "mode" to be executable).
	
	<li> To run your first shell script, you can now type its name at the terminal:
	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
./setupProject
	</pre>
	<li> Check to see that your script works, type <tt>ls</tt> to see the new directories your script you created.

</ol>

<p> <b>Troubles with vi?</b>  It's not intuitive-- here's more on vi:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/tutorials/l-vi/index.html">IBM tutorial for vi</a>
	<li> <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/UnixAndC/Editors/ViIntro.html">UC Davis 5-minute Tutorial</a>
	<li> <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheetvi.php">Ryan's Tutorial vi cheat sheet</a>

</ul>
If you hate <tt>vi</tt>, just edit using <tt>gEdit</tt> (the Linux version of TextEdit) or IDLE.

<p> Once you have a working script, see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.
