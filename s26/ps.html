<h1>Homework Exercises<br>
CSCI 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2026<br><br>
</h1>
<hr>

<p>All students registered by Friday, January 23, are sent a Gradescope registration invitation to the email on record on their Brightspace account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, fill in the form on Brightspace.  Include that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and your EmpID.  We will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Brightspace/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it, and we will update the Gradescope registration.</p>


<h3>General Notes</h3>

<p>Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you set aside a block of time most days to work on programming and the course.  </p>

<p>The programs build on the concepts and code developed during lecture, lab, and through the reading.  Mastery of material is assessed via
	<ul>
	  <li> Autograding of the programs submitted to <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, </li>
	  <li> The weekly <a href="cw.html#quizzes">written quizzes</a> with questions about the programs you wrote and concepts from lecture and lab,</li>
	  <li> The oral <a href="cw.html#cr">code reviews</a> where, each week, you code a program in 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE">IDLE</a>, and</li>
	  <li> The paper <a href="cw.html#final">final exam</a> which covers all material from the semester.  
	</ul>

While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (20% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-affairs/office-of-student-conduct/">Office of Student Affairs</a>.
</p>


<h4>Autograder Notes</h4>

<p> The majority of the programs this semester are written in Python (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for getting started with Python); it is noted below when other formats or languages are used. For Python programs, the autograder expects a <code class="inline">.py</code> file, using only the specified libraries, and does not accept iPython/Jupyter notebooks.  Since all assignments are designed to be uploaded as a single file, the autograder is set up for direct file upload instead of Github.  If submitting directly (drop-and-drag onto the webpage), the file name is flexible but must have the extension <code class="inline">.py</code>, unless otherwise noted.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.10 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).</p>
	
<p>	To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
	<ul>
		<li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
		<li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, his first program might be:</p>	
<pre><code class="python">"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter1870@hunter.cuny.edu
Date: September 1, 2025
This program prints: Hello, Thomas Hunter
"""

print("Hello, Thomas Hunter")
</pre></code>

<p>For each program, the upper right hand side of the description contains the due date, suggested reading, and, when applicable, the available libraries.  When testing your Python programs, the autograder uses Python 3.10 and has available the libraries listed.  If the available libraries is <i>none</i>, no additional libraries are used (e.g. no <code>import</code> statement is needed in your program).</p>

<p>
You may submit your assignments up to three weeks before the due date and are encouraged to work ahead.  To receive credit, assignments must be submitted by the deadline to <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope.</a>  For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s25/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.
Since Gradescope gives limited feedback, run your program first locally (on your computer or a lab computer) where the compiler messages will pinpoint errors and help debug your code.  For example, if Gradescope gives you a <tt>"The autograder failed to execute..."</tt> error, it means your program has an error (in this case, it's usually the file contains non-Python commands.). The local Python compiler will give the line of your file with the error, where Gradescope will only say that there's a general problem.  For more information on installing Python on your computer, see the <a href="resources.html#install">installation guides</a>.</p>

Currently, the program processes the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward 50 steps
          <li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left

          <li> '^':  lifts the pen
          <li> 'v':  lowers the pen
        </ul>
        For example, if the user enters the string <tt>FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL</tt>, the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.

	<p>Write a Python program that contains a function called, <tt>main()</tt>.  Your function should print out a greeting to you by name.  For example, if your name is Thomas Hunter, invoking <tt>main()</tt> would print:</p>

	<pre><code class="text">Hello, Thomas Hunter</code></pre>

	<p>You should use conditional execution, so your file can be run as a standalone program or imported so the function can be used elsewhere.</p>

	<p>To test your program, we will run it two ways:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We will run it as a stand-alone program and see that it outputs the greeting.  If your program is called, <code>student.py</code>, then we would run it, <code>python3 student.py</code>, to see that it prints the greeting.</li>
		<li>We will import your file and directly call the function. If your program is called, <code>student.py</code>, we would import it into a Python program,  <code>import student</code>, and in that program, call your function, <code>student.main()</code>,  to see that it prints the greeting. </li>

	<p>
	Write a function <tt>count_red_pixels()</tt> that takes the filename of an image and returns the number of pixels where the red channel is the dominant color. A pixel is considered "red-dominant" if its red value is greater than both its green value AND greater than its blue value.
<br>For example, a pixel with RGB values (200, 150, 100) would be counted as red-dominant because 200 > 150 and 200 > 100. However, a pixel with RGB values (200, 250, 100) would not be counted because the green value (250) is greater than the red value (200).
	</p>

  	<p>An example, using the file <a href="../images/red_forest.png">red_forest.png</a> as the input file

		<p><b>!!!! UPDATE !!!!</b></p>

	<p> Download csv file from <a href="../files/demo_boro.csv">2013 to 2018 Demographic Snapshot Borough</a>. Your program should ask the user for the borough, an name for the output file, and then display the fraction of Grade K to 6 enrollment that has lived in that borough, over time. Then print out the minimum, maximum, median, mean, and standard deviation of total enrollment in that borough (round to 3 decimal numbers).

	<p> A sample run of the program:
<pre><code class="text">
Enter borough name:  Bronx
Enter output file name:  bronxFraction.png
minimum of total enrollment for Bronx is 233588
maximum of total enrollment for Bronx is 241986
median of total enrollment for Bronx is 239955.0
mean of total enrollment for Bronx is 239283.0

</code></pre>
		
	<p> The file <tt>bronxFraction.png</tt>:

		<p><img src="../images/bronxFraction_s23.png" width=300>


<p><i>Hint:</i> First create a column that calculates the fraction of Grade K to 6 vs. Total Enrollment. Then get borough data using either <code>groupby</code> and <code>get_group</code> function or query method. You can test both approaches. Suppose the original data frame is saved in variable <tt>df</tt> and the input borough name is put in variable <tt>borough</tt>.

<pre><code class="python">borough_data = df.query("Borough == '" + borough + "'")</code></pre>

<p>Then <tt>borough_data</tt> has data for the specific borough. Plot fraction using this data.

<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <code>plt.show()</code> and <code>plt.imshow()</code> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.

	<p>This program asks that you fill in the missing function to animate hurricane data (inspired by the 2018 <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2018/ventura-hurricane-tracker/nifty-hurricanes.html">Nifty Hurricane Program</a> by Phil Ventura).  Your function, <tt>animate(t,lat,lon,wind)</tt> takes as input:

		</li><li> <tt>lat</tt>: an integer storing the current latitude,
		</li><li> <tt>lon</tt>: an integer storing the current longitude, and
		</li><li> <tt>wind</tt>: the current wind speed in miles per hour.
	</li></ul>

	<p>
	Your function should move to the turtle to the current location (longitude, latitude), and then based on the
	<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</a>, change the turtle to be:
	</p><ul>
		<li> red and pen size 5 for Category 5 (windspeed &gt; 157 mph)

	</li><li> blue and pen size 1 for Category 1   (windspeed in 74-95 mph)

	<p><b>Housing Map</b></p>	

	<p>
	Using <a href="https://plotly.com/python/maps/">Plotly Express</a> (see <a href="lab9.html">Lab 9</a>), write a program that asks the user for the name of a CSV file, choice of unit size, and name of the output file, and creates a map with scaled markers for all the housing of that size from the input file.  When the user hovers over the marker, the name of the property, the number of units of that size and the coordinates.  The overall title for the map should include the housing type.</p>

	<p>The housing data is available from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr/about_data">NYC Open Data</a> listing affordable and market rate housing by building location.  We created a smaller file, of just 2023 housing units, <a href="../files/Affordable_Housing_Production_by_Building_2023.csv">Affordable_Housing_Production_by_Building_2023.csv</a>. </p>

	<p>If the user enters for size:</p>
	<ul>

		<li>1:  use the column: "1-BR Units"</li>
		<li>2:  use the column: "2-BR Units"</li>
		<li>3:  use the column: "3-BR Units"</li>

		<li>5:  use the column: "5-BR Units"</li>

	</ul>


	<p>A sample run:

Enter number of bedrooms (0 for studio, 1 for one bedroom,...): 2
Enter output file name: two_bed_2023.html

	<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:550px">housing_df = housing_df[ housing_df['Project Name'] != 'Confidential']</pre>		

	</p>
	
	Once the user has specified the housing type, you should make sure that you only plot rows that have information about that housing size (e.g. that are not null ).  For example, if they are interested in 1 bedroom apartments:

As such, the function name must match exactly (else, the scripts cannot find it). Before submitting your program for grading, remove any commands that are outside a function definition. To test the function you wrote, we import your file and then call the function directly. Code outside of function definitions will give compilation errors and prevents the tests from completing (giving a grade of 0).

	year, and D is the death rate of 8.4 for every 1000 people (8.4/1000). In 2017, the population
	of United States was 325.7 million. Your program should ask the user for the number of years and print expected population over those years starting from 2017. Each line should have: the year and the population (in millions).
		
				<p> A sample run:
<pre><code class="text">Please enter the number of years: 10

Year 2018  327.00
Year 2019  328.31
Year 2020  329.62
Year 2021  330.94
Year 2022  332.27

		<i> Note:  if you would like to make the output a bit prettier, you can include the library (<code>#include &lt;iomanip&gt;</code>) which has a command to limit the number of places after the decimal point printed to 2 before you print:</i>

	<p><b>Twos' Complement</b></p>

	<p> Write a <b>C++ program</b> that asks the user for a whole number between -31 and 31 and prints out the number in "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement</a>" notation, using the following algorithm:

	<ol>
		<li> Ask the user for a number, n.
		<li> If the number is negative, print a 1 and let x = 32 + n.
		<li> If the number is not negative, print a 0 and let x = n.
		<li> Let b = 16.
		<li> While b > 0.5:
			<ol>
				<li> If x >= b then print 1, otherwise print 0
				<li> Let x be the remainder of dividing x by b.
				<li> Let b be b/2.
			</ol>
		<li> Print a new line ('\n').
	</ol>
