<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>  <b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i>
This course presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on problem-solving and computational thinking through 'coding': computer programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS minor. MATH 12500 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-requisite for intended Majors.

<p><b>Course Format:</b> This course is taught as a blend of in-person and on-line activities. Each week the course meets:
	<ul>
		<li> 1.5 hours of <b>in-person lecture</b> (Tuesdays, 10:00am-11:15am, 118 Hunter North),
		<li> 1.0 hours of <b>labs to be completed by the students independently</b> (links to the labs can be found in <a href="cw.html#labs">coursework</a>), and			
		<li> 0.5 hours of <b>in-person assessments</b> (appointments available Mondays-Fridays, 11:30am-5:15pm, 1001G Hunter North).
	</ul>

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience.
Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the programs, the lab exercises, the textbook and other assigned reading.
<!--Students should review topics from
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.-->




<p><b>Lecture Participation:</b> At every lecture (Tuesdays, 10:00am-11:15am), there will be a paper lecture slip to be submitted. 
	<ul>
		<li>The lecture slips contain a challenge to be solved in pairs or triples during lecture.</li>
		<li>Completed lecture slips (that include the names with who you worked) are given full credit. </li>
		<li><b>There are no make-ups for lecture slips.</b>  Instead, the lowest grades are dropped.  The participation grade is based on the highest 10 lecture slip grades.</li>
		<li>Throughout the term, there will be events offered by the department and Tech Career Center focusing on current topics in computer science for which bonus participations are available (all will be announced on Brightspace).</li>
	</ul>


	<p><b>Lab Exercises:</b> Each week, there is a lab exercise that reinforces material from lecture and the reading and introduces pratical aspects of the material covered in lecture.
		<ul>
			<li>These are available on the <a href="cw.html#lab">coursework</a> webpage.   
			<li>Lab exercises can be completed at home or in 1001G where the laptops have all required software.</li>
			<li>To set up your home computer, see <a href="lab0.html">Lab 0</a> for installation instructions. </li>
		</ul>
	
	
	<p><b>Homework:</b>  <a href="ps.html">Exercises</a> are posted on the class
	website. These short assignments reinforce concepts
	covered in lecture and lab and are the basis of the quizzes, code reviews, and final examination.
	<ul>
		<li>As the semester progresses, the homework will require work on design and programming outside of class to complete. You should plan to spend approximately 3 hours per week on the homework. </li>
		<li>To receive full credit, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted by <b>5 PM on the due date</b> via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.  </li>
		<li><b>No late homework is accepted.</b>  Instead, the highest 50 grades are used for your homework total.</li>
		<li> Homework is due most weekdays and complement the lecture and lab from the previous weeks. You can be submit assignments up to 4 weeks early and are encouraged to work ahead.  Due dates are staggered to provide flexibility-- should you be unable to work for a few days you need not miss the deadline. You may submit as many times as you like before the deadline.  The highest grade will be used.  </li>
	</ul>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b>  Every week, there will be an quiz to be taken in 1001G HN, on the lecture notes, reading, and homework.
<ul>
	<li> Quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and the first pass of many programming job interviews).  The exception is the bonus Quiz 0, based on the syllabus, which is available on Brightspace.	
	<li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, the lowest grades are dropped.  The quiz grade is based on the highest 10 quiz grades.
  	<li> For the quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
  	<li> <b>Quizzes are offered 11:30am-5:15pm Mondays to Fridays</b>, when classes are in session <b>in 1001G HN</b>. Appointments are strongly recommended (available via Navigate).
	<li> There is extra credit for completing paper quizzes early (up to 15%).  See <a href = "cw.html#quizzes">coursework</a> page for details.</li>

</ul>


<p><b>Code Reviews:</b> Every week, there will be an in-person code review on the recently submitted programs.
<ul>
	<li> For each code review, you choose <a href = "cw.html#cr">one of the listed programs</a> to code using the built-in Python editor IDLE on a computer in the lab.  Your grade is based on your ability to implement and explain working code.</li>
	<li> There are no make-up code reviews.  Instead, the lowest grades are dropped.  The code review grade is based on the highest 10 code review grades.</li>
	<li> <b>Code Reviews are offered 11:30am-5:15pm Mondays to Fridays</b>, when classes are in session <b>in 1001G HN</b>. After the first week, appointments are strongly recommended (available via Navigate).</li>
	<li> There is extra credit for completing code reviews early (up to 15%).  See <a href = "cw.html#quizzes">coursework</a> page for details.</li>		
</ul>



<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  <a href="final/final.html">Sample and past exams</a> are available on the course webpage.
<b>You must take and pass the final (60 points or more) to pass the course.</b>

<p><b>Grades:</b>  Your overall grade is based on showing mastery of the material.  Grading is not relative to how well you perform over others in the class, but, instead, it is based on your demonstration of mastery.  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>10%:  Homework.</li>
      <li>30%:  Quizzes.</li>
      <li>20%:  Code Reviews.</li>
      <li>10%:  Participation.	</li>
      <li>30%:  Final Exam. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
	overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
	programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
	are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
	<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
	<blockquote>
	<i>
	Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
	</blockquote>
	All incidents of cheating will be reported to the <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-affairs/office-of-student-conduct/">Office of Student Conduct</a> in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.  For the first incident of cheating or plagiarism your grade
	will be a 0 and it will not be dropped as the lowest. For the second incident, you
	will fail the class.  Note that if you have previous incidents on file, the Office of Student Conduct may impose harsher santions than we propose.
	
	<p>As a general rule:  submitting code that didn't come from the class webpages or textbook and you didn't type it, then it's cheating.  More specifically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can use code
		from the textbook, lecture, and lab exercises unless otherwise specified in the assignment. </li>
		<li>If you need help writing programs for the course, tutoring is available Mondays to Fridays, 11:30am-5:15pm.</li>
		<li>While you are encouraged to discuss with others, all work submitted must be your own. Sharing your solution or debugging others' code is an academic integrity violation.  </li>
		<li>You may not use code from the Internet (e.g. StackOverflow) nor seek help from online forums (e.g. Discord).</li> 
		<li>You may not post your solutions to assignments and course deliverables where it
		is accessible to others. </li>
		<li>While Large Language Models (e.g. chatGPT, coPilot) can be used to assist in providing explanations and
		suggestions. However, these tools may not be used to generate answers to graded assignments. Do not upload the
		assignment questions to an LLM as a prompt. Do not use AI chat/suggestions.  Submitting such as your own work is a form of cheating and plagiarism.</li>
	</ul>
