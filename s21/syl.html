<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience.
Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the online Labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.
<!--Students should review topics from
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.-->

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.

<p><b>Course Format:</b> This course is taught as a blend of synchronous meetings and online activities.  Each week the course meets:
<ul>
	<li> 1.5 hours of lecture (Tuesdays, 9:45am-11:00pm, Zoom -- link provided on course home page),
	<li> 0.5 hours of quiz assessments (Lecture previews due on Tuesday mornings, Lab Quizzes due on Wednesday evenings), and
	<li> 1.0 hours of <b>Online Labs to be completed by the students independently</b> (links to the labs can be found in the <a href="../s20.html">Course Outline</a>).
</ul>



<p><b>Lecture Preview:</b> Before every lecture, there is a short on-line quiz based on the material for the week.  The preview is available on Blackboard the day before lecture and can be repeated as many times as you would like until the start of lecture.  Turning in lecture previews will only help your grade. There are no make-ups for lecture previews. Instead, if you miss a lecture preview, your grade on the final exam will replace that grade.

<p><b>Lecture Participation:</b> At every lecture (Tuesdays, 9:45am-11:00am on Zoom), we will administer a lecture quiz available electronically via Gradescope.  Completed lecture quizzes are given full credit. The quiz will only be available for 5 minutes when we announce it during lecture.  Turning in lecture quiz will only help your grade. There are no make-ups for lecture quizzes.  Instead, if you miss a lecture quiz, your grade on the final exam will replace that grade.



<p><b>Quizzes:</b> Each week, there will be an online quiz (available on Gradescope) based on the Online Labs.
<ul>
	<li> Lab Quizzes become available on Tuesday mornings.
	<li> Lab Quizzes are <b>due each Wednesday by 6pm.</b>
  <li> You have 15 minutes to complete the quiz from when you start. After 15 minutes it will automatically end and save your answers.
  <li> Ideally you will work on the Online lab sometime between Tuesday and Wednesday, and take the quiz right after completing the lab to asses your understanding. <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission-online-assignment" target="blank">Here is a video</a> that illustrates what taking an online assignment on Gradescope looks like for students.
  <li> Taking quizzes is also great practice for the final exam, which will be in the same format, albeit longer.
  <li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).

</ul>

<!--
<p><b>Code Reviews:</b> Every week, there will be an in-person code review on the recently submitted programs.
<ul>
	<li> For each code review, you choose one of the programs due the previous week to explain on the whiteboard.
	<li> All code reviews must be taken by the deadline.
	<li> There are no make-up code reviews. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing code reviews (the final exam will also replace a code review grade when you take the code review but do better on the final exam).
	<li> Code reviews are on the whiteboard (echoing the style of many programming job interviews).
		</ul>
</ul>
-->

<p><b>Laboratory Exercises:</b> Each week, you are expected to work through the associated Online Lab exercises.  These are available on the course webpage (you will need a computer with Python and Unix shell, and as the term goes on, C++. See the first lab for installation instructions).

<p><b>Homework:</b>  <a href="ps.html">Programming exercises </a> are posted on the class
website, usually three weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and lab.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete. You should plan to spend approxiimately 3 hours per week on programming exercises. To receive full credit for a program, the program must
perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted by <b>6pm on the due date</b>.
<br>While every 5 programs should be worked on the week of the corresponding lab, due dates are one week later to provide flexibility (should you be unable to work for a few days you need not miss the deadline). Still, you should work on the programming assignments the week of the corresponding lab. If you work on assignments at their due dates you are likely falling behind.
<br>Programs are submitted via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>.
You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores).
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>


<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  <a href="f20/final/final.html">Sample and past exams</a> are available on the course webpage. Keep in mind, however, that these samples are for written exams. This semester the exam will be administered electronically via Gradescope, its format being closer to that of the Lab Quizzes, albeit longer.
<br>We will end most lectures with past exam questions and review to prepare for the final.
<b>You must take and pass the final to pass the course.</b>

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 35%. </li>
      <li>Lab Quizzes: up to 25% (if you miss a quiz, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that paper quiz grade).</li>
    <!--  <li>Code Reviews: up to 5% (if you miss a code review, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that code review grade).</li> -->
      <li>Lecture Previews: up to 5% (if you miss a lecture preview, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that lecture preview grade).</li>
      <li>Participation (Lecture Quizzes): up to 5% (your grade on the final will replace the grades for missing or incomplete lecture slip).	</li>
      <li>Final Exam: 30% (up to 65% if you do better on the final exam than on lab quizzes, lecture previews, and lecture quizzes). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
