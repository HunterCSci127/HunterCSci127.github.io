<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: February 2, 2021
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6pm</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in Blackboard drop-in tutoring, Blackboard discussion board and by e-mail (<b><tt>hunterCSci127help AT gmail.com</tt></b>). Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your porgram on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (35% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the Lecture notes, the Lab and take the Lab Quiz on Tuesday and Wednesday, then set aside a block of time on Thursday, Friday and Monday to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

		<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

<p>
  <br><b><i>Hints:</i></b> Let the turtle move forward 200 steps and use the sequence forward/left/stamp.
  <br>This assignment aims to challenge you to analyze the image to deduce the process (given a description of the output, write the program to produce it), which is how software developers often approach problems.
  <br><b>So what should you do? </b>Try to puzzle out the image, break down what the turtle does, then apply what you have learned so far about definite loops (for loops) and turtle graphics to reproduce that process. Here some guiding questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How many turtles do you see? How many repetitions?
    <li>What does the turtle do in each repetition?
    <li>Once you figured out the answer to the previous two questions, play around with the angle to produce the image.
    <li>Look up the turtle functions <tt>pencolor()</tt> and <tt>fillcolor()</tt> to produce the turtle colors?
    <li>You have used that background color before, what color was it?
  </ul>
  Hope this helps!!!

<p>Write a program that asks the user for a 6-digit hex number and uses it as the hex code to stamp 6 turtles of that color.
<br>Let the turtle walk forward 50 steps between stamps and use the sequence stamp/forward (i.e. stamp before moving the turtle, such that the last turtle is produced by its position, not a stamp).

<p>A sample run of the program:

<p>Write a program that creates an image of purple and cyan horizontal stripes. Think color not shade: Purple = red and blue only, no green. Cyan = green and blue only, no red.
  <br>Your program should ask the user for the size of your image, the name of the output file, and create a <tt>.png</tt> file of stripes.  For example, if the user enters 10, your program should create a 10x10 image, alternating between purple and cyan stripes.

          <li> '^':  lifts the pen
          <li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		      <li> 'r':	 change turtle color to red
          <li> 'g':  change turtle color to green
		      <li> 'b':  change turtle color to blue
        </ul>
        For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.

        <p>
        Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
        <ul>
          <li> 'c':  change the turtle color to <tt>"cyan"</tt>
          <li> 'T':  stamps a turtle shape
          <li> 'S':  draws a square with side = 50 and sequence forward/left
        </ul>

  <p> Write two functions, <tt>nestedPolygon()</tt> and <tt>fractalPolygon()</tt>.  Both functions take three parameters: a turtle, an edge length and number of sides.  The pseudocode for <tt>nestedPolygon()</tt> is:

  <pre>
      nestedPolygon(t, length, sides):
      1.  If length > 10:
      2.     Repeat sides times:
      3.         Move t, the turtle, forward length steps.
      4.         Turn t left 360/sides degrees.
      5.     Call nestedPolygon with t, length/2 and sides.
  </pre>

  <p>The pseudocode for <tt>fractalPolygon()</tt> is very similar:
  <pre>
      fractalPolygon(t, length, sides):
      1.  If length > 10:
      2.     Repeat sides times:
      3.         Move t, the turtle, forward length steps.
      4.         Turn t left 360/sides degrees.
      5.         Call fractalPolygon with t, length/2 and sides.
  </pre>

<p> There is a subdtle difference in the pseudocode of the two functions above, but it is very important and makes the difference between the two images. Observe the execution and think about it!!!
  <p>A template program, <tt>nestingPolygons.py</tt>, is available on the
  <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">CSci 127 repo on github</a>.

<p>Write a program that, given an input image, creates a tile-collage by repeating modified copies of the input image (inspired by the 2013 <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2013/guzdial-collage/" target="_blank">Nifty Collage</a> by Mark Guzdial)
  <p>Using the template program, <tt>tilesCollage.py</tt>, available on the
  <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127" target="_blank">CSci 127 repo on github</a>, fill in the missing functions:

  <ul>
    <li> <tt>fourfold_tile(img)</tt>  Takes an image and
      <b>returns</b> a new larger image that contains 4 copies of <tt>img</tt> in a tile layout, with 2 copies at the top and 2 copies at the bottom
    <li> <tt>remove_hue(img, hue):</tt> Takes an image and a hue, either "red", "green" or "blue",
      and turns off the corresponding color channel in <tt>img</tt>. If the value of <tt>hue</tt> is not one of the expected, it prints: <i>No such hue.</i>
      This function does not return a value, it simply switches off the color channel on the input image.
    <li> <tt>mirror(img, axis)</tt>  Creates and <b>returns</b> a mirrored copy of <tt>img</tt> along <tt>axis</tt>, either 'x', 'y', 'xy' (mirrored along both x and y axes)
    If the value of <tt>axis</tt> is not one of the expected, it prints: <i>Invalid axis.</i>
    </ul>

<p> A sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:450px">
Enter input file name: octopus.png
Enter output file name: collage.png

<p><img src="../images/marylin.png" width=150>
<p>And output:
<p><img src="../images/warhol_collage.png" width=300>

<p><b>Hints:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>To fit four copies of img (two at the top and two at the bottom) the new image must be twice as large and twice as tall
    <li>To mirror an image over an axis, think of it being the same image but it <b>steps backwards</b> on that axis (mirror on x axis means reversing the rows, etc.)
    <li>To remove a hue, turn off that color channel (no light in that channel).
  </ul>

<p>The grading script runs the whole program as well as each function separately ('unit tests') to determine correctness.  As such, the function names must match exactly as indicated above (else, the scripts cannot find them).

<p>	Using folium (see <a href="lab9.html">Lab 9</a>), write a program that asks the user for the name of a CSV file, name of the output file, and creates a map with markers for all the traffic collisions from the input file.

<p>A sample run:

 <p>  To restrict the markers to a particular borough, make a copy of the dataframe after you <tt>groupby("Borough")</tt> and then <tt>get_group</tt> for the borough entered by the user.
<!--  For example, if you named your dataframe <tt>df</tt> and stored the borough entered by the user in a variable named <tt>br</tt>, then you make a copy of the dataframe as: <tt> dfCopy = df.groupby("Borough").get_group(br)</tt>
  <br> Now your dataframe copy contains only textile drop-off locations for the borough specified by the user, and you can look at all the rows to extract "Latitude" and "Longitude" as you did in <a href="lab9.html">Lab 9</a> to place markers on the map. -->
  You can use the value in the  <tt>"Address"</tt> column to name each marker.

<p> Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints out the corresponding day of the week. Your program will consist of two functions:
 <ul>
   <li> <tt>main()</tt> is responsible for obtaining <b>and validating</b> the input and printing the output. In order to validate the input, it will <b>repeatedly</b> ask for a number until a valid number between 1 and 7 is entered.
   <li> <tt>dayString()</tt> which returns the day of the week corresponding to the number.
</ul>
 <p> A template <tt>days.py</tt> is available on our <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">github repo.</a> You must <b>fill in <tt>dayString()</tt></b> to implement its desired behavior  and <b>modify <tt>main()</tt></b> to validate the input.

<p> A sample run of your program:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:650px">

</pre>

 <p>Note:  The grading scripts are expecting that your function is called <tt>dayString()</tt>.  You need to use that name, since in addition to running the entire program, the scripts are also "unit testing" the function-- that is, calling that function, in isolation, with different inputs to verify that it performs correctly.
