<br>
<h2>1. World Maps with Turtles</h2>

<p>We are going to use Python to make maps.  Let's start by mapping cities of the world.
Locations in the world are usually indicated by their longitude and latitude.
<ul>
    <li> <b>Longitude</b> measures the number of degrees east or west of the prime meridian.  When written as a number, it ranges from -180 to +180.
	<li> <b>Latitude</b> measures the number of degrees north or south of the equator.  When written as a number, it ranges from -90 (the south pole) to +90 (the north pole).
</ul>

We will use those ranges to be our coordinates:  (-180, -90) to (180,90).  Let's map some cities:

<p> In the trinket below, map the following cities (GIS coordinates are rounded to the nearest whole number):
<ul>
	<li> New York City (longitude: -74, latitude: 41),
	<li> Los Angeles (longitude: -118, latitude: 34),
	<li> Paris, France (longitude: 2, latitude:49),
	<li> Tokyo, Japan (longitude: 140, latitude: 35), and
	<li> Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (longitude: -43, latitude: -23) .
</ul>

<br>
<h2>2. Using Plotly</h2>

<p>UPDATE TO PLOTLY</p>
<p>
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/folium">Folium</a> is a Python package that uses the javascript <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet.js</a> library to make interactive maps. Instead of popping up a <tt>matplotlib</tt> window, folium creates an <b>.html</b> file that you can open (and view interactively) with a browser.  After the program runs, open the corresponding <tt>.html</tt> file in a web browser to see your map.

<p>
(Folium is installed on the lab machines,  To check to see if your home machine has it, type at the Python prompt:
<tt>
import folium
</tt>
<br>
If you get an error, go to the terminal, and download it:
<pre><code class="shell">pip install folium</code></pre>
and the package will download and install.)

<h4>Our First Map</h4>

<p>

<iframe src="../files/world.html" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>To make a map in folium, the process is:
<ol>
	<li> Write a program in Python, using folium.
	<li> Run the program, which outputs an <tt>.html</tt> file.
	<li> Open the <tt>.html</tt> file in a browser.
</ol>

<p> Here's our first program:
<pre><code class="python">#Import the folium package for making maps
import folium

#Create a map, centered (0,0), and zoomed out a bit:
mapWorld = folium.Map(location=[0, 0],zoom_start=3)

#Save the map:
mapWorld.save(outfile='tempMap.html')</code></pre>

<p>
Save this file and run it.  It will create a file called <tt>tempMap.html</tt>.
Open your favorite browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE, etc.) and choose "Open File" and then choose the file <tt>tempMap.html</tt>.  You should see a map of the world.

<h4>Map of New York City</h4>

<!--<p>
<img src="hunterMap.png" height=400>

<p>
<b>UPDATE!!</b>-->

<p>
Let's make another map, focused on New York City.  To do that, when we set up the map object, we need to reset the location to New York City and the increase the zoom level:
<pre><code class="python">import folium

mapCUNY = folium.Map(location=[40.75, -74.125], zoom_start=10)</code></pre>

<p> Let's add in a marker for Hunter College:
<pre><code class="python">folium.Marker(location = [40.768731, -73.964915], popup = "Hunter College").add_to(mapCUNY)</code>
</pre>

<p>and create the .html file:
<pre><code class="python">mapCUNY.save(outfile='nycMap.html')</code></pre>

Save your commands to a file and run via IDLE.  Your program will create an HTML file called, <tt>nycMap.html</tt>.  Open it in your favorite browser to make sure it creates a map of NYC with a marker for Hunter College.  When you have a running program, see the <a href="ps.html#ps9">Programming Problem List</a>.

<h2>3.  Plotting from Files</h2>

We can combine the mapping of folium with the tools we have used for CSV files.

<p>
<iframe width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" src="../files/cunyLocations.html"></iframe>

<p>Let's make an interactive map of the CUNY campuses.  We can download a CSV file from <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Education/City-University-of-New-York-CUNY-University-Campus/i5b5-imzn/data">data.ny.gov</a>:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="../files/CUNYcampuses.csv">CUNY Campuses</a>
</ul>
(Export as a <b>.csv</b> file and save in the same directory as your programs.) Open the file to make sure you have all the lines (should be 23) and to check if the column headings occur in the first row (they do, so no need to skip rows when reading in the file).

<p>
Let's use Pandas to read in the file.  We will need to import pandas and folium:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">import folium
import pandas as pd
</pre>

<p>To read in the CSV file, we'll use pandas' CSV reader.  We'll print out the campus locations to make sure that all were read in:
    <pre><code class="python">cuny = pd.read_csv('cunyLocations.csv')
print(cuny["Campus"])</code></pre>
Note:  we saved our CSV file to <tt>cunyLocations.csv</tt>.  If you saved it to a different name, change the input parameters for <tt>read_csv()</tt> to the name of your file.


<p>Next, let's set up a map, centered on Hunter College:
<pre><code class="python">mapCUNY = folium.Map(location=[40.768731, -73.964915])</code></pre>

<p>
We need to add markers for each campus.  We're going to iterate through the rows of dataframe to create the markers:
<pre><code class="python">for index,row in cuny.iterrows():
    lat = row["Latitude"]
    lon = row["Longitude"]
    name = row["Campus"]
    newMarker = folium.Marker([lat, lon], popup=name)
    newMarker.add_to(mapCUNY)</code></pre>
For each row in the file, we find the latitude, longitude, and name of the campus, and use those to create a new marker which we add to our map.  We repeat for each row, until we have made markers for all 23 campuses in the file.
<!--(Note:  we're using an older way to add markers (since it's simpler), and  some versions of folium will give a warning to use the newer version).
(Note:  this isn't the most efficient way to plot points.  We'll discuss a better way-- creating a geoJSON layer-- next week.)-->

<p>Lastly, let's save our map:
    <pre><code class="python">mapCUNY.save(outfile='cunyLocations.html')</code></pre>

<p>
To view your map, open a browser.  From the browser, open the file:  <tt>cunyLocations.html</tt>.

<h2>4.  Finding Errors</h2>

Finding, and fixing errors, in your programs is a very useful skill.  Let's look at a program with lots of errors and work through how to identify the issues and fix them.  If you cloned the repo above, you will have a copy of <a href="https://github.com/stjohn/csci127/blob/master/errors.py">errors.py</a> on your computer (you can also download from the webpage).  When loaded into IDLE, it does not run:
<pre><code class="python"># errors.py is based on dateconvert2.py from Chapter 5 of the Zelle textbook
#     Converts day month and year numbers into two date formats

def main()
    # get the day month and year
    day, month year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")

    date1 = str(month)"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April",
              "May", "June", "July", "August",
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[-1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)

    print("The date is" date1, "or", date2+".")

main()</code></pre>
Instead, a dialog box pops up and says "invalid syntax":<br>
<br>
<img src="../images/errorWindow1.jpg">
<br>

<p>The red line indicates where the intepreter has found an error.  Can you tell what it is?  Syntax is another word for grammar, so, it most likely missing `punctuation' or a misspelling of some sort.  We have spelled <tt>def</tt> correctly and have the right number of parenthesis, so, what else is missing?

<p>The answer is after the parenthesis on a function definition, a colon is required.  Add that in:
<pre><code class="python">    def main():</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../images/errorWindow2.jpg"><br>
<br>Instead of the whole line being highlighted, only the word <tt>year</tt> is.  The Python intepreter was not expecting <tt>year</tt> and says there is a grammatical mistake.  Since <tt>year</tt> does not include any grammatical constructs, we need to look <i>before</i> the message to see where the error is.
Do you see it?

<p>The answer is lists of variables need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre><code class="python">    day, month, year = ...</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Once more we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../images/errorWindow3.jpg"><br>

<p>It has highlighted the first item, <tt>date1</tt> on the line.  That is a name and looks fine.  So, as above, let's look before the highlighted error to see if there's a problem.  The line above it is:
<pre><code class="python">    day, month, year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")</code></pre>
It did not highlight this line, so, the problem must be at the end.  Do you see it?

<p>The answer is we are missing a closing parenthesis.  The line has two left parenthesis but only one right parenthesis.  Add the right parenthesis in:
<pre><code class="python">    ... and year numbers: "))</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../images/errorWindow4.jpg"><br>

<p>The intepreter does not understand the second " on the line.  Why?  What is this line doing?  It's constructing a string and storing it in the variable <tt>date1</tt>.  How do you build a string out of smaller strings?

<p>The answer is to put smaller strings together (called concatenation) we need to use the plus sign (+).  The line is missing a plus sign right before the quotes.  Add the plus sign in:
<pre><code class="python">    date1 = str(month) + "/" ...</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box, but this one has a different message:<br><br>
<img src="../images/errorWindow5.jpg"><br>

<p><tt>EOL</tt> means "End of the line", so, the message says that the end of the line was reached before you finished defining the string.  How can you fix this?

<p>The answer is to end the string, using quotation marks.  The line is missing a quotation mark at the very end.  Add the quotation mark :
<pre><code class="python">    ...+ ",  + str(year)"</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Our familiar dialog box returns:<br><br>
<img src="../images/errorWindow6.jpg"><br>

<p>We have seen this type of error before.  How do you fix it?

<p>The answer is lists of arguments need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre><code class="python">    ... date is", date1 ...</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It runs!  Now let's make sure it works.  Type in at the prompt:
<pre><code class="python">Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014</code></pre>
Uh oh, instead of output, we get the following messages:
<pre style = "color: red">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 18, in <module>
    main()
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 13, in main
    monthStr = months[month+1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
<p>When you see messages like this, go to the very last line:
<pre style = "color: red">
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
It says that the index for our list is out of range.  An index is the item of the list that we're accessing.  For example, <tt>months[1]</tt> has index <tt>1</tt> and will give us <tt>February</tt>.  The range of the index for a list is <tt>0</tt> to one less than the length of the list.  In the case of <tt>months</tt>, the range is <tt>[0,1,2,...,11]</tt>.  What went wrong when we entered <tt>12</tt> for our month?


<p>The answer is we used <tt>month+1 = 12 + 1 = 13</tt> as the index:
<pre><code class="python">    monthStr = months[month+1]</code></pre>
which is out of range.  What do we want instead?  Instead of adding <tt>1</tt>, we should subtract <tt>1</tt>.  Change it in the program:
<pre><code class="python">    monthStr = months[month-1]</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It still runs, but does it work?  Let's try the same input again:
<pre><code class="python">Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
The date is 12/31/14 or December 31,  + str(year).</code></pre>

<p>Something odd is happening at the end-- <tt>str(year)</tt> does not look right.  Let's look at the print statement:
<pre><code class="python">date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)"</code></pre>
The intepreter is treating <tt>",  + str(year)"</tt> as a string (instead of evaluating <tt>str(year)</tt>), so, we must have put the quotation mark in the wrong place before.  Let's move it:
<pre><code class="python">date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ","  + str(year)</code></pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Success!  But try a few other inputs, just to make sure.  It is always good to try cases that are near the `boundary' of what's allowed, since those are the places we are most likely to make mistakes:
<pre><code class="python">Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1,1,2015
The date is 1/1/2015 or January 1,2015.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1, 2, 2003
The date is 2/1/03 or February 1,2003.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 4, 7, 1976
The date is 7/4/1976 or July 4,1976.</code></pre>

<p>We have removed all the errors, and the program now runs correctly!
