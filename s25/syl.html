</h3>
</div>


<div>
<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>  <b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i>
This course presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on problem-solving and computational thinking through 'coding': computer programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS minor. MATH 12500 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-req for intended Majors.

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience.
Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the online Labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.
<!--Students should review topics from
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.-->

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.

<p><b>Course Format:</b> This course is taught as a blend of synchronous online meetings and <b>online as well as in-person activities.</b>  Each week the course meets:
<ul>
	<li> 1.5 hours of lecture (Tuesdays, 10:00am-11:15am, 118 Hunter North, ground floor of the North Building),
	<li> 0.5 hours of <b>in-person assessments</b> (appointments available between Mondays-Fridays, 11:30am-5:30pm, 1001G Hunter North), and
	<li> 1.0 hours of <b>Online Labs to be completed by the students independently</b> (links to the labs can be found in the <a href="../f24.html#courseoutline">Course Outline</a>).
</ul>




<p><b>Lecture Participation:</b> At every lecture (Tuesdays, 10:00am-11:15am), there will be a paper lecture slip to be submitted. Completed lecture slips are given full credit. Turning in lecture slips will only help your grade. There are no make-ups for lecture slips. Instead, if you miss a lecture slip, your grade on the final exam will replace that grade.



<p><b>Quizzes:</b>  Every week, there will be an quiz to be taken in 1001G HN, on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and programming assignments.
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
	<li> <a href = "quizzes.html">All quizzes must be taken by the deadline.</a>
  <li> Quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and the first pass of many programming job interviews).
  <li> For the quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
  <li> <b>Quizzes are offered 11:30am-5PM Mondays to Fridays</b>, when classes are in session <b>in 1001G HN</b>. You must sign up for a time slot in advance. A link to make appointments is available on Blackboard.
  <li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).

</ul>


<p><b>Code Reviews:</b> Every week, there will be an in-person code review on the recently submitted programs.
<ul>
	<li> For each code review, you choose <a href = "quizzes.html">one of the listed programs</a> to explain verbally.
	<li> All code reviews must be taken by the deadline.
	<li> There are no make-up code reviews. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing code reviews (the final exam will also replace a code review grade when you take the code review but do better on the final exam).
		</ul>
</ul>


<p><b>Weekly Online Lab (replaces a recitation section):</b> Each week, you are expected to work through the associated Online Lab.  These are available on the course webpage (you will need a computer with Python and Unix shell, and as the term goes on, C++. See the first lab for installation instructions). Laptops will also be available in 1001G HN with all required software.

<p><b>Homework:</b>  <a href="ps.html">Programming exercises </a> are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and lab.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete. You should plan to spend approxiimately 3 hours per week on programming exercises. To receive full credit for a program, the program must
perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted by <b>5 PM on the due date</b>.
<br>While every 5 programs should be worked on the week of the corresponding lab, due dates are staggered to provide flexibility (should you be unable to work for a few days you need not miss the deadline). Students who work on the programming assignments the week of the corresponding lab tend to have greater success rate in the course. <u>Students who work on assignments at the due dates are more likely to miss deadlines and fall behind</u>.
<br>Programs are submitted via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.
You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores).
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>


<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  <a href="final/final.html">Sample and past exams</a> are available on the course webpage.
<b>You must take and pass the final (60 points or more) to pass the course.</b>

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Programming Assignments: 30%. </li>
      <li>Lab Quizzes: up to 25% (if you miss a quiz, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that paper quiz grade).</li>
      <li>Code Reviews: up to 5% (if you miss a code review, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that code review grade).</li>
      <li>Participation (lecture slips): up to 10% (your grade on the final will replace the grades for missing lecture slips).	</li>
      <li>Final Exam: 30% (up to 70% if you do better on the final exam than on lab quizzes lecture slips, and code reviews). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
