<h2>Programming Problem List<br>
CSCI 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2025<br><br>
</h2>
<hr>

<p>All students registered by Tuesday, 21 January are sent a Gradescope registration invitation to the email on record on their Brightspace account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, write to <code class="inline">stjohn@hunter.cuny.edu</code>.  Include in your email that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and your EmpID.  We will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Brightspace/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it, and we will update the Gradescope registration.</p>


<h3>General Notes</h3>

<p>Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you set aside a block of time most days to work on programming and the course.  </p>

<p>The programs build on the concepts and code developed during lecture, lab, and through the reading.  Mastery of material is assessed via
	<ul>
	  <li> Autograding of the programs submitted to Gradescope, </li>
	  <li> <a href="work.html#quizzes">Written quizzes</a> based on the programs and labs, </li>
	  <li> <a href="work.html#cr">Code Reviews</a> based on the programs, and </li>
	  <li> Final exam on the material.  
	</ul>

While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (20% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-affairs/office-of-student-conduct/">Office of Student Affairs</a>.



<h4>Autograder Notes</h4>

<p> The majority of the programs this semester are written in Python (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for getting started with Python); it is noted below when other formats or languages are used. For Python programs, the autograder expects a <code class="inline">.py</code> file, using only the specified libraries, and does not accept iPython notebooks.  Since all assignments are designed to be uploaded as a single file, the autograder is set up for direct file upload instead of Github.  If submitting directly (drop-and-drag onto the webpage), the file name is flexible but must have the extension <code class="inline">.py</code>.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.6 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).
	
<p>	To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
	<ul>
		<li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
		<li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
	</ul>
	
For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, his first program might be:
<pre><code class="blockcode">"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter1870@hunter.cuny.edu
Date: February 1, 2025
This program prints: Hello, Thomas Hunter
"""

print("Hello, Thomas Hunter")
</pre></code>

<p>
You may submit your assignments up to two weeks before the due date and are encouraged to work ahead.  To receive credit, assignments must be submitted by the deadline to <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope.</a>  For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s25/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.
Since Gradescope gives limited feedback, run your program first locally (on your computer or a lab computer) where the compiler messages will pinpoint errors and help debug your code.  For example, if Gradescope gives you a <tt>"The autograder failed to execute..."</tt> error, it means your program has an error (in this case, it's usually the file contains non-Python commands.). The local Python compiler will give the line of your file with the error, where Gradescope will only say that there's a general problem.  For more information on installing Python on your computer, see the <a href="resources.html#install">installation guides</a>.

<h2>Programming Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<!--problem 1-->
	<li>
	<p style="float:right;margin-left:10pt"><b>Due Date: 5pm, Monday, 3 February</b><br>
	<b>Reading: Think CS:  <a href= "https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/toctree.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a> & <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>
	<b>Available Libraries:  Core Python 3.10+</b></p>
  <p><b>Hello</b></p>

	<p>	Write a program that prints "Hello" followed by your name to the screen.  For example, if your name is "Thomas Hunter", when your program is run, it would print:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
Hello, Thomas Hunter</pre>		

<!--problem 2-->
<li>
	<p style="float:right;margin-left:10pt"><b>Due Date: 5pm, Tuesday, 4 February</b><br>
	<b>Reading: Think CS:  <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a> & <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>
	<b>Available Libraries: turtle, Core 3.10+</b></p>
  <p><b>Triangle</b></p>

	<p>Write a program that draws a triangle using the <tt>turtle</tt> library.
    <br><img id="triangle" alt="program 2" src="../images/p2_triangle.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".
	</i>

	<li > <b>Due Date: February 11</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS
	<a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/TherangeFunction.html">Section 4.7</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that prints out the numbers from 2 to 17.


		<p>The output of your program should be:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:200px">2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

15
16
17
</pre>

<!--problem 7-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: February 13</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="lab2.html"> Lab 2 </a></b><br>

		<p>Using the string commands introduced in <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, write a Python program that prompts the user for a message, and then prints the message, the message in upper case letters, and the message in lower case letters.

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:

Enter a message:  I love Python!
I love Python!
I LOVE PYTHON!
i love python!
</pre>

	<p><i>Hint:  Your program should be able to take any phrase the user enters and prints it, it in upper case letters, and it in lower case letters.  To do that, you need to store the phrase in a variable and print variations of the stored variable.
