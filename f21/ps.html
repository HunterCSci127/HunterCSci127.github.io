<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: September 2, 2021
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6pm</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in Blackboard drop-in tutoring, Blackboard discussion board and by e-mail (<b><tt>hunterCSci127help AT gmail.com</tt></b>). Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your porgram on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (35% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the Lecture notes, the Lab and take the Lab Quiz on Tuesday and Wednesday, then set aside a block of time on Thursday, Friday and Monday to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

		<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

<p> Write a program that uses turtle graphics to generate the image below:
<p><img id="turtleFlower" alt="program 5" src="../images/f21program5.png" width="250">
<p>
  <br><b><i>Hints:</i></b> Create the same image shown above. Turtle should move forward 100 in the direction it starts facing initially.  
  <br>This assignment aims to challenge you to analyze the image to deduce the process (given a description of the output, write the program to produce it), which is how software developers often approach problems.
  <br><b>So what should you do? </b>Try to puzzle out the image, break down what the turtle does, then apply what you have learned so far about definite loops (for loops) and turtle graphics to reproduce that process. Here some guiding questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How would you create one rhombus first if the angle is 45?
    <li>How many turtles do you see? How many repetitions? How many rhombuses do you need to create?
    <li>What does the turtle do in each repetition?
    <li>Once you figured out the answer to the previous two questions, play around with the angle to produce the image.
    <li>Look up the turtle functions <tt>pencolor()</tt> and <tt>fillcolor()</tt> to produce the turtle colors?
    <li>You have used that background color before, what color was it?
  </ul>
  Hope this helps!!!

<p>Write a program that asks the user for a 6-digit hex number and uses it as the hex code to stamp 4 turtles of that color into a square
<br>Let the turtle walk forward 100 steps between stamps and use the sequence stamp/forward (i.e. stamp before moving the turtle, such that the last turtle is produced by its position, not a stamp).

<p>A sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">

<p> <b>IMPORTANT:</b>  before submitting your program for grading, <b>remove the commands that show the image</b> (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <tt>plt.show()</tt> and <tt>plt.imshow()</tt> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.

Ask the user for amount of social media followers they have.
Compute and output the their influencer tier as follows:
  - Error if followers less than 0
  - Hyper Influencer if amount of followers less than 1K followers
  - Nano Influencer if amount of followers 1K-10K followers (not including 10k)

<p><b>REVIEW from Lecture/Lab 4</b>
<p>Write a program that creates an image of khaki and rosy horizontal and vertical stripes. 
  <br>
  <br>The color codes are below. 
  <br>
  RGB(188,143,143), #BC8F8F - Rosy Brown 
  <br>
  RGB(240, 230,140) #F0E68C - khaki 
  <br>
  Use the color converter to get the RGB% from hex:https://andylangton.co.uk/tools/colour-converter
  <br>
  <br>Your program should ask the user for the size of your image, the name of the output file, and create a <tt>.png</tt> file of stripes.  For example, if the user enters 10, your program should create a 10x10 image, alternating between khaki and rosy brown stripes.

<p>
A sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter the size: 10
Enter output file: 10stripes.png

<p>
<b><p><b>Review from Lecture/Lab 4</b></b>

<p>The program, <tt>turtleString.py</tt> (available at:  <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127"target="_blank">
	https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127</a>) takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward 50 steps
          <li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
          <li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
          <li> '^':  lifts the pen
          <li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		      <li> 'r':	 change turtle color to red
          <li> 'g':  change turtle color to green
		      <li> 'b':  change turtle color to blue
        </ul>
        For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.

        <p>
        Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
        <ul>
          <li> 'c':  change the turtle color to <tt>"cyan"</tt>
          <li> 'T':  stamps a turtle shape
          <li> 'S':  draws a square with side = 50 and sequence forward/left
        </ul>

  <p> Write two functions, <tt>nestedPolygon()</tt> and <tt>fractalPolygon()</tt>.  Both functions take three parameters: a turtle, an edge length and number of sides.  The pseudocode for <tt>nestedPolygon()</tt> is:

  <pre>
      nestedPolygon(t, length, sides):
      1.  If length > 10:
      2.     Repeat sides times:
      3.         Move t, the turtle, forward length steps.
      4.         Turn t left 360/sides degrees.
      5.     Call nestedPolygon with t, length/2 and sides.
  </pre>

  <p>The pseudocode for <tt>fractalPolygon()</tt> is very similar:
  <pre>
      fractalPolygon(t, length, sides):
      1.  If length > 10:
      2.     Repeat sides times:
      3.         Move t, the turtle, forward length steps.
      4.         Turn t left 360/sides degrees.
      5.         Call fractalPolygon with t, length/2 and sides.
  </pre>

<p> There is a subdtle difference in the pseudocode of the two functions above, but it is very important and makes the difference between the two images. Observe the execution and think about it!!!

You need to use that name, since in addition to running the entire program, the scripts are also "unit testing" the function-- that is, calling that function, in isolation, with different inputs to verify that it performs correctly.

	<p><i><b>Hint:</b>  See <a href="lab10.html">Lab 10</a> for an example of validating the input.</i>

<p>Create a rock papers scissors game. You have to print the output as specified below. 
<p>Must print <tt>ComputerMove</tt> for each round. In another line print out the winner of the round. After the game finishes, you <b>must print out the last-round winner</b>.
<p>Rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Player moves: "1" = rock, "2" = paper, "3" = scissors
  <li> Computer moves:  "1" = rock, "2" = paper, "3" = scissors
  <li> Must have <b>global winner variable</b> to track status of game. 
  <li> If player wins (winner = "human")
  <li> If computer wins (winner = "computer")
  <li> If round is a tie (winner = "draw")
  <li> If playermove is invalid, <b>greater than 3 or less than 1</b> (winner = "invalid")
</ul>
<p>Game logic:  Loop until playerMove is <b>less than zero</b> (used to terminate game)</p>
<ul>
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>rock (1)</b> and computer move is <b>rock (1)</b>, its a draw. 
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>rock (1)</b> and computer move is <b>paper (2)</b>, human wins.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>rock (1)</b> and computer move is <b>scissors (3)</b>, computer wins.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>paper (2)</b> and computer move is <b>rock (1)</b>,  human wins.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>paper (2)</b> and computer move is <b>paper (2)</b>,  its a draw.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>paper (2)</b> and computer move is <b>scissors (3)</b>,  computer wins.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>scissors (3)</b> and computer move is <b>rock (1)</b>,  computer wins.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>scissors (3)</b> and computer move is <b>paper (2)</b>,  human wins.
  <li>  If playerMove is <b>scissors (3)</b> and computer move is <b>scissors (3)</b>,  its a draw.
