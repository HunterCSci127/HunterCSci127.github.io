  <h3>Quizzes</h3>
  <p>
  Each week, there will be a paper quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and online lab
  exercises.
  <ul>
  	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
  	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
  	<li> Quizzes are offered on weekdays, 11am to 5pm in lab 1001E HN.  You can reserve a time to take the quiz in advance.  There are also drop-in slots (when you arrive in 1001E, there is a sign-in screen for the next available slot).
  	<li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
  	<li> The quizzes are on paper, and you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
  </ul>

  <h3>Code Review</h3>

  <p>
  There will also be weekly walk-throughs ("code reviews") where you explain one of the programs you wrote to a teaching assistant.  Code reviews are integral to software design and development: explaining your coding decisions and convincing another it works correctly leads to improvements in the design and lessens unexpected behaviors and errors.

  <ul>
  	<li> Each week focuses on several programs (see below). You can choose which program you would like to explain.
  	<li> After you choose a program, the teaching assistant will ask you questions about that program and how it relates to that week's theme.
  	<li> If something is unclear or you are stuck, ask questions!  Having a two-way conversation about the concepts, the code, and the design are highly encouraged.
  	<li> <b>There are no make-up code reviews.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing code review grades (the final exam will also replace the grade when you take it but do better on the final exam).
