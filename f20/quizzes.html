<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>
Each week, there will be an online quiz (available on Gradescope) based on the Online Labs.
<ul>
	<li> Lab Quizzes become available on Tuesday mornings.
	<li> Lab Quizzes are <b>due each Wednesday by 6pm.</b>
  <li> You have 15 minutes to complete the quiz from when you start. After 15 minutes it will automatically end and save your answers.
  <li> Ideally you will work on the Online lab sometime between Tuesday and Wednesday, and take the quiz right after completing the lab to asses your understanding. <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission-online-assignment" target="blank">Here is a video</a> that illustrates what taking an online assignment on Gradescope looks like for students.
  <li> Taking quizzes is also great practice for the final exam, which will be in the same format, albeit longer.
  <li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).

</ul>
