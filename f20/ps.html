<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: September 2, 2020
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6pm</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are one week later than the Lecture/Lab the assignments are based on. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work at the due dates!</b>
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in Blackboard drop-in tutoring, Blackboard discussion board and by e-mail (<b><tt>hunterCSci127help AT gmail.com</tt></b>). Please take advantage of this.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your porgram on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the Lecture notes, the Lab and take the Lab Quiz on Tuesday and Wednesday, then set aside a block of time on Thursday, Friday and Monday to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.

<h2><u> Lecture / Lab 1</u></h2>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 10 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/toctree.html">Chapters 1</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">2</a> & <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f20/lab1.html">Lab1</a></b><br>

	<p>	Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

	<li > <b>Due Date:  11 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading:  Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">Chapter 4</a> & <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f20/lab1.html">Lab1</a></b><br>


		<p>Write a program that draws a star.
      <br><img id="1star" alt="program 2" src="../images/star.png" width="100">
		<br><br>
		<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".
		</i>

	<p><i>Hint:  See the  <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</i>

		<p> Copy the program from <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/InstancesAHerdofTurtles.html">Section 4.3</a> into a file on your computer and modify the program to have a 'hotpink' background, <tt>tess</tt> color black, <tt>alex</tt> color 'lightgreen' and let <tt>alex</tt> draw a pentagon instead of a square:

<p>
<img src="../images/program3.png" height=200>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make only the modifications indicated here, all other behaviors should stay the same. (i.e. distance forward, pen size etc.)

		<p> Write a program that implements the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a> ("informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm") below:

<pre>
    Set the turtle shape to be a turtle
    Set the color to purple

    Repeat i 15 times:
        Walk forward 50 steps
        Turn left 24 degrees

    Turn left 125 degrees

    Repeat i 15 times:

    Turn left 125 degrees

    Repeat i 15 times:
        Walk forward 50 steps
        Turn left 24 degrees

  	</b><br>
<p> Write a program that uses turtle graphics to generate the image below:
<p><img id="turtleFlower" alt="program 5" src="../images/program5.png" width="200">

  <p>Here is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">complete list of turtle commands</a> for your reference.
  <br><b><i>Hint:</i></b> Look up the difference between <tt>pencolor()</tt> and <tt>fillcolor()</tt>. Let the turtle move forward 200 steps. Use the sequence forward/left/stamp.
  <br><b><i>More hints:</i></b>While many of you may have noticed that this image is very similar to that of the <i>Turtle star</i> program on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">turtle documentation page</a>, that program includes things we didn't cover yet or simply don't want to do in this context and, unless you are feeling adventurous, it is best to ignore that code.
  <br>Instead, while the above image is certainly inspired by that <i>Turtle star</i>, this assignment aims to challenge you to analyze the image to deduce the process (given a description of the output, write the program to produce it), which is how software developers often approach problems.
  <br><b>So what should you do? </b>Try to puzzle out the image, break down what the turtle does, then apply what you have learned so far about definite loops (for loops) and turtle graphics to reproduce that process. Here some guiding questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How many turtles do you see? How many repetitions?
    <li>What does the turtle do in each repetition?
    <li>Once you figured out the answer to the previous two questions, play around with the angle to produce the image.
    <li>Look up the turtle functions <tt>pencolor()</tt> and <tt>fillcolor()</tt> to produce the turtle colors?
    <li>You have used that background color before, what color was it?
  </ul>
  Hope this helps!!!

Write a program that implements the following pseudocode using turtles:

<pre>
Ask the user for number of stamps
Set the turtle shape to 'circle'
Lift the turtle pen up
Set steps to 20
Repeat stamps times:
    Stamp
    If the number of this loop iteration is divisible by 4
        Increment steps by 2
    Move foward by steps
    Turn right by 24 degrees

	In Lecture 4, we designed a program to make a Hunter logo 'H' on a 10x10 grid.   Write a program that creates a red 'U' logo for University on a 30x30 grid.

	<p>
	<img src="../images//uLogoBlue.png" style="padding:5px" height=200>

	<p> The grading script is expecting:
	<ul>
		<li> The file to be saved as:  <tt>logo.png</tt>.
		<li> The grid to be 30 x 30.
		<li> The 'U' to be 0% red, 0% green, and 100% blue.  The lower part of the 'U' should be the lower third of the image; the left part of the 'U' should be the left third of the image; and the right part of the 'U' should be the the right third of the image.
		<li> The remaining pixels in the image should be white (100% red, 100% green, and 100% blue).
	</ul>

       <p>The program, <tt>turtleString.py</tt> (available at:  <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127"target="_blank">
	https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127</a>) takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward 50 steps
          <li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
          <li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
          <li> '^':  lifts the pen
          <li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		  <li> 'r':	 change turtle color to red
		  <li> 'g':  change turtle color to green
		  <li> 'b':  change turtle color to blue
        </ul>
        For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.

        <p>
        Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
        <ul>
          <li> 'S':  makes the turtle stamp
          <li> 'D':  makes the turtle stamp a dot
          <li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards 50 steps
          <li> 'p':  change the turtle color to purple

  <p> For this program, you should consider all characters in the <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/files/ASCIITable.pdf" target="_blank">ASCII table</a> higher than 31 to be special characters if they are not uppercase letters, lowercase letters or numbers.
  <p><i>Hint: think about the order in which you check for different type of characters. It is also important to think about what characters should you include in your test strings to ensure that your program always produces the correct output (i.e. catch all edge cases!!!)</i>

  <p>Your function, <tt>animate(t,lat,lon,wind)</tt> takes as input:
  <ul>
    <li> <tt>t</tt>: a turtle,
      <li> <tt>lat</tt>: an integer storing the current latitude,
      <li> <tt>lon</tt>: an integer storing the current longitude, and
      <li> <tt>wind</tt>: the current wind speed in miles per hour.
      </ul>

  <p>
  Your function should move the turtle to the current location (longitude, latitude), and then based on the
  <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php" target="_blank">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</a>, change the turtle to be:
  <ul>
    <li> red and pen size 5 for Category 5 (windspeed > 157 mph)
    <li> orange and pen size 4 for Category 4  (windspeed in 130-156 mph)
    <li> yellow and pen size 3 for Category 3   (windspeed in 111-129 mph)
    <li> green and pen size 2 for Category 2   (windspeed in 96-110 mph)
    <li> blue and pen size 1 for Category 1   (windspeed in 74-95 mph)
    <li> white and pen size 1 if not hurricane strength
  </ul>

  <p>A template program, <tt>hurricane.py</tt>, and background image, <tt>mapNASA.gif</tt>, are available on the
    <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127" target="_blank">CSci 127 repo on github</a>.
    The grading script does not run the whole program, but instead runs each of your functions separately ('unit tests') to determine correctness.  As such, the names of the functions must match exactly the ones listed above (else, the scripts cannot find them).

  <p>Two test files (<a href="../files/irma.csv" target="_blank">irma.csv</a> and <a href="../files/jose.csv" target="_blank">jose.csv</a>) are from the <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2018/ventura-hurricane-tracker/nifty-hurricanes.html" target="_blank">Nifty site</a>.  Additional CSV files are available there.

    <p>
    <i>Hint:  You may find the following turtle commands useful:  <tt>color()</tt>, <tt>goto()</tt>, and <tt>pensize()</tt>.</i>

		<p>
		Using folium (see <a href="lab9.html">Lab 9</a>), write a program that asks the user for the name of a CSV file, name of the output file, and creates a map with markers for all the traffic collisions from the input file.

		<p>A sample run:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter CSV file name:  collisionsThHunterBday.csv

		<p>which would produce the html file:

      <p>(The demo above is for October 18, 2016 using the time the collision occurred ("TIME") to label each marker and changed the underlying map with the option:
