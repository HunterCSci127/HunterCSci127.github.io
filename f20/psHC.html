	<li > <b>HC 1:  Team Contract and Dataset (Airbnb or another dataset of your choice)</b>  <b style="float:right">Due Date: 1 September</b>  <br>

	<p>
	<img src="../images/airbnb.png" height = 200>

	<p>  Throughout the semester, we will analyze the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data" target="_blank">Airbnb dataset</a> of New York listings from 2019.

    <h4>Step 1 -- Project structure:</h4>
    <p>We will work in teams. Each team will choose a borough to analyze. Each team member will then choose a neighborhood in that borough to report on.
    <br>Throughout the semester each team will provide different analyses of the overall borough supplemented by analyses of the chosen neighborhoods.
    <br>These analyses will be broken down across different assignments and will be a mix of research and data analysis.
    <p>We propose to use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data" target="_blank">Airbnb dataset</a> of New York listings from 2019. However, we give you the freedom to choose a different dataset if that would inspire you more. Another great place to look for data is <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/" target="_blank">NYC Open Data.</a> If you choose a different dataset, it must have the following properties to guarantee that you will be able to fulfill all the assignments despite working with different data:
      <ul>
        <li> The data must have an attribute (column) corresponding to neighborhoods (preferably NYC)
        <li> It must include some numerical data
        <li> It must include some categorical data
        <li> It must include geographical locations (latitude and longitude columns, or exact address column)
      </ul>
and must be approved by the instructor.
<p>Discuss with your assigned team to decide on a dataset, then move on to Step 2. <br><i>Note: You don't need to identify the alternate dataset in this assignment, but if you are considering it you should indicate so in Step 2 and <b>must identify the dataset no later than our next meeting on September 4.</b></i>

<h4>Step 2 -- Team Contract:</h4>
 <p>Work with your assigned team to complete the <a href="../files/hcTeamContract.docx">Team Contract</a>.
<p>Once your contract is complete and signed by all team members, <b>upload a .pdf</b> to the assignment <tt>HC 1.</tt> in the honors section of <a href="http://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>. This will be a group submission (one submission per team). Unlike the Python code, it is not automatically graded.

  <li > <b>HC 2:  Neighborhood Analysis
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 8 September</b>  <br>

  <p>To begin, discuss with your team to pick a neighborhood in your team's borough (a different neighborhood for each team member). Keep in mind that you want all the neighborhoods together to be representative of the borough. You also want to be sure your neighborhood is well represented <a href="../files/AirBnB_NYC_2019.csv" target="_blank">in the dataset</a>.
  <p>Create a single page summary of your neighborhood that includes <b>at least</b> the following:
	<ul>
		<li> Name of the neighborhood (include in the title),
		<li> The zip code(s) of your neighborhood,
		<li> A map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted,
		<li> A photo or image that captures your neighborhood and
		<li> The demographics of your neighborhood.
	</ul>
Your summary should exceed these minimum requirements to receive full credit. Include in your summary any information you think will be relevant to the future analysis of your dataset (e.g. airbnb listings)
<br>A great resource for your analysis is <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/" target="_blank">Social Explorer</a>. <i>Note: you don't need to necessarily create an account. From the top menu, select <tt>Resources - Demographic Profiles</tt> and enter the zip code(s) of your neighborhood to find a wealth of information.</i>
  <p>Submit a .pdf file containing your summary.
  </p>



	<hr>
		<li > <b>HC 3:  Neighborhood Rankings
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 15 September</b>  <br>

  <p> Design a ranking for the most desirable features of a neighborhood.

  <p>There are multiple rankings of New York City Neighborhoods.  For example,
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/new-york-city-metro-area/">Niche</a>,

    <li> <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/ranking">DNA Info's rankings</a>,
    <li> <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/live/best-nyc-neighborhoods-for-college-grads-2016">Brick Underground</a>,
    <li><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/19/16329796/nyc-best-neighborhood-transit-walk-bike-score">Curbed's Walkable Neighborhoods</a>,
    <li> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/where-should-you-actually-live-in-new-york-city?utm_term=.dvk8EJ3Ne#.clDxXrwq4">BuzzFeed</a>,
    <li> <a href="https://www.streetadvisor.com/search/cities-in-new-york-city-new-york">Street Advisor</a>
  </ul>


  With your group:
  <ul>
    <li> Assess what these rankings have in common and how they differ.
    <li> Which ranking do you favor and why?
    <li> What qualities make a neighborhood a desirable place book a room or apartment in?
    <li> Collate a list of the three most important.
    <li> How does each neighborhood in your team's borough fare according to this ranking?
  </ul>

  <p>Submit a .pdf file containing your assessment of the rankings and the three most desirable qualities, as well as a ranking of your team's borough (if all neighborhoods fare the same, you may indicate so and group the discussion to the borough).  You should use complete sentences, compare and contrast the rankings above and justify the three qualities that your group thought most important.
 This will be a group submission (one submission per team).
  </p>


	<hr>
		<li > <b>HC 4:  Synchronous Discussion
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 25 September IN LAB</b>  <br>

   <p>In this meeting we will discuss your findings from <tt>HC 2</tt> and <tt>HC 3</tt>. Before the meeting, your team should select a speaker from the designated speakers in section A.- c. on your Team contract. This team member will be responsible for summarizing the overall discussion of the borough from that of the neighborhoods to the entire group. The speaker may also call on another team member if a neighborhood-specific aspect is particularly relevant to the discussion.

		<p>No submission necessary. This assignment will be graded based on your group's contribution to the discussion.
      <br><b>Grading criteria:</b>
      <ul>
        <li> Speaker presents one particular finding from HC2, explains why it was chosen and indicates if individual neighborhood analyses aligned or differed on this particular finding.
        <li> Speaker presents the 3 neighborhood qualities chosen for HC3, explains why these were chosen and indicates if individual neighborhoods aligned or differed for this ranking.
        <li> Speaker provides satisfactory summary in 5 minutes
      </ul>
		</p>


	<hr>
	<li > <b>HC 5:  Highlighted Map
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 6 October</b>  <br>


    <p><img src="../images/hunterSatMap.png" height = 300>
    <img src="../images/hiLight.png" height = 300>

		<p>
    For this program, we will create a highlighted map centered around your neighborhood, with the region within about a 1/4 mile box around a marker at the center of the neighborhood at full brightness, the region outside that box at 50% brightness.

		<p> To do this:
		<ul>
			<li> Create a .png file of a satellite map, centered on your neighborhood (Google maps works well for this, but you can use any mapping site to create your base map).
			<li> Write a Python program that reads in an image and saves the image to another file.  Run your program to make sure the reading and saving of an image works.
      <li> Set the upper region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  uses slices and see example in Lecture 3 and 4).  Run your program to make sure it has dimmed up the upper region and adjust to get the correct dimenssions.
      <li> Set the lower region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  think about what negative numbers mean as indices).  Run your program and fix any bugs.
			<li> Next, dim the side regions (hint:  think about what parts of the image have not been dimmed and change only those regions.)
		</ul>

		<p> Submit your answer as a .pdf file to gradescope.

      <br>(Entries, exits, and difference via turnstile #1 at 68th Street-Hunter College station for the week ending 1 September 2018)


		<p> In <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a>, we introduced
		<a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC OpenData</a>.  As part of the OpenData initiative, the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/MTA-Data/mmu8-8w8b">MTA</a> releases information about the subways, buses, and commuter trains.  To access the real-time data, MTA provides feeds (requires registration).  We will focus on the historical data stored about stations.

		<p> THe MTA keeps track of the number of people entering and exiting each station via the <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html">turnstiles</a>.  Readings of how many people entered and exited are measured every 4 hours.
    Some stations measure the numbers at midnight, 4am, 8am, noon, 4pm, and 8pm.  Others are measured on slightly shifted schedules, but always 4 hours apart.  For example, the 68th Street-Hunter College station has each turnstile measured at 1am, 5am, 9am, 1pm, 5pm, and 9pm.  These numbers are recorded as cumulative running totals.  For example, here is some of the data from the 68th Street-Hunter College station for September 22:

<pre>
C/A,UNIT,SCP,STATION,LINENAME,DIVISION,DATE,TIME,DESC,ENTRIES,EXITS
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,01:00:00,REGULAR,0026638604,0015384642
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,05:00:00,REGULAR,0026638606,0015384646
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,09:00:00,REGULAR,0026638640,0015384847
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,13:00:00,REGULAR,0026638946,0015385117
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,17:00:00,REGULAR,0026639543,0015385340
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,21:00:00,REGULAR,0026639975,0015385496
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/23/2018,01:00:00,REGULAR,0026640099,0015385542
</pre>

    <p> The last two entries on the lines are the entries and exits for that turnstile (in this case, the numbered <tt>00-00-00</tt>).  At 1am, the entry total was <tt>0026638604</tt> and the exit total was <tt>0015384642</tt>.  Four hours later, the entry total was <tt>0026638606</tt> and the exit total was <tt>0015384646</tt>.  So, over that 4-hour period from 1am to 5am, <tt>0026638606-0026638604 = 2</tt> people entered the station via that turnstile.  Similarly, 4 people left the station via that turnstile.

    <p>Pick a turnstile in your station and make a plot of the number of entries and a plot of the number of exits for the week ending <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_180901.txt">1 September 2018</a>.

    <p>Some useful tips:
    <ul>
       <li> If you have your turnstile data stored in a variable, <tt>turnsData</tt>, you can select the data for a single station (for example, <tt>68TH-HUNTER CO</tt>) with the command:
         <pre>
turnsHunter = turnsData[ turnsData["STATION"] == "68ST-HUNTER CO" ]</pre>
        You can similarly select a single turns(for example, <tt>00-00-01</tt>) with <tt>turnsHunter</tt> and the column name <tt>SCP</tt>.
      <li> Some of the data files had extra spaces after "EXITS".  Pandas thinks those spaces are part of the name of your column.  You can either include the spaces (i.e. "EXITS   ") or you can edit the CSV file and remove the trailing spaces and save the revised file.
      <li> You can create a column that contains the difference between the entries and exits at each time point with:
        <pre>
myTurns["Entries - Exits"] = myTurns["ENTRIES"] - myTurns["EXITS"]</pre>
      <li> Since the default colors for pyplot are a bit garish, the above plots use the <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org">Seaborn</a> package (can be downloaded as part of the Anaconda distribution or following the directions on their downloads page).  It's totally optional, but if you would like to use a similar palette, including the line with your imports:
        <pre>
          import seaborn as sns</pre>
      will then change the default colors and templates to Seaborn.
    </ul>

		<p> Submit a .pdf file that includes the following:
        <ul>
          <li> The name of your station and the name of the turnstile you are using for your plots.
          <li> Three plots for the week's data:
              <ul>
                  <li> the cumulative number of entries,
                  <li> the cumulative number of exits, and
                  <li> the difference of entries and exits.
                </ul>
          <li> Any patterns you noticed in the data (e.g. the plots above for turnstile <tt>00-00-00</tt> show that over the weekend it had similar number of people using it for entry and exit, but during the week if was used much more for entries).
        </ul>

	<li > <b>HC 9:  Webpage</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 28 October</b>  <br>

	<br>




		<p> We are going to be using github to make webpages for your projects.  There will be only one site for each project, but we want everyone to set up there own page as a warm-up exercise.

		<p>Create a github page for your neighborhood.
		<ol>
			<li> If you haven't done so already, set up a repository for your neighborhood project (see the getting started tutorials from <a href="lab8.html">Lab 8</a> on how to set up a repository).
			<li> Follow through the options for setting up a page for your project (right under the "Ready to get started?).
			<li> Include on your neighborhood page:
				<ul>
					<li> the name of the neighborhood,
					<li> the outline of the neighborhood (the .json file you created in the previous classwork for HC 6),
					<li> the basic demographics & statistics from the HC 1, and
					<li> station usage statistics from HC 8.
		</ol>

		<p>  Submit a .pdf file that contains the URL of your project on github (web address) and a screenshot of your project.

	<li > <b>HC 10: Morning Commute Snapshot</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 4 November</b>  <br>

    <p><img src="turnstileEntryTotals.png" height=300>
      <img src="turnstileExitTotals.png" height=300>
      <br>(Entries and exits (all turnstiles) at 68th Street-Hunter College station for morning commute for the week ending 1 September 2018.)


		<p> Write a program that takes a weekly turnstile data file and makes a graph of <i>all the entries</i> and a graph of <i>all the exits</i> during the morning commute for your L-train station for that data.  The x-axis of your histogram should be the days of the week.  The bars in your plot should be the number of people entering the station between 5am and 9am (i.e. subtract the cumulative total at 5am from the cumulative total at 9am, or the closest 4-hour block measured for your station).  Similarly, the bars in the second plot should be the exits from your station over the week.

    <p> Hints:
      <ul>
          <li> In HC 8, we focused on a single turnstile.  This program asks for <b>all the turnstiles</b> at your station aggegated together.
            That is, for the morning commute of each day, you need the total number of entries (and exits) summed up across all the turnstiles.  Look at the dataFrame and identify the rows that you will need to compute this and select those to another dataFrame (like what we did in HC 8).
          <li> Once you have retricted to your station, make two separate data frames, one containing the 5am rows for each turnstile (i.e. rows that have value <tt>== "5:00:00"</tt>) and the other containing the 9am, in a similar fashion to above.
          <li> Some new pandas commands that are incredibly useful are:
            <ul>
              <li> <tt>groupby()</tt>:  which you can use to group rows with the same values
              <li> <tt>sum()</tt>: will sum up the groups by your chosen columns
            </ul>
            For example,
            <pre>
entries = turnsHunter9.groupby(by = ['DATE'])['ENTRIES'].sum()-turnsHunter5.groupby(by = ['DATE'])['ENTRIES'].sum()</pre>
            creates a new series (list) of those who entered each day at 9am and then subtracts off those who entered at 5am (assuming that <tt>turnsHunter9</tt> and <tt>turnsHunter5</tt> were selected as suggested above).

            <li> Two more useful commands:
              <ul>
              <li> <tt>to_frame()</tt>:  will take the series (list) that results from <tt>sum()</tt> and convert it into a dataFrame (so we can then plot it in pretty ways)
              <li> <tt>reset_index()</tt>:  fixes the column labels after the frame is created.
            </ul>
            For example,
            <pre>
en = entries.to_frame().reset_index()</pre>
            converts the series above into a dataFrame and then resets the index.  Once done, the techniques for plotting dataFrames can be used for <tt>en</tt>.
      </ul>

		<p> Submit a .pdf file that contains the name of your station, as well as the plots for the morning commute entries and exits.

      StreetEasy</a>

		<p> The honors section will have final presentations on 6 December, addressing, the  <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/ltrainclosure.shtml">L-train tunnel closure</a>:

  		<blockquote>
  			For 15 months starting in April of 2019, all MTA New York City Transit (NYCT) L train service will be suspended across the East River and within Manhattan to repair damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. The L train will still run within Brooklyn, serving all stops. The temporary closure will directly affect 275,000 of the L Train's 400,000 daily riders, and indirectly affect many more throughout the city. All alternative transit services and traffic management policies are temporary for the duration of the L train closure.
  		</blockquote>

    <p>In particular,
      <blockquote>
  			Focusing on different L-train neighborhoods, how will the residents get to work?
  		</blockquote>

		<p>You may work in teams of up to 3 students to develop your presentation, which has 2 parts:
		<ul>
			<li> A 60-second lightning presentation (upto 2 slides) that contains who is on the team, the neighborhoods you chose (at least one per group member and at least two, whichever is greater), and a brief description of your the effects of the L-train tunnel closure on these neighborhoods, how well will the current MTA plans mitigate the effects, and what additional transit services would be needed, and
			<li> A computer "poster" (aka a github site) consisting of a website with a description of your neighborhoods, an analysis of the effects of the L-train tunnel closure and MTA plans on your neighborhoods and what additional services are needed.
		</ul>

		<p>For this group assignment, include in a .pdf file:
		<ul>
			<li> The neighborhoods that your team has chosen,
			<li> The names of the team members,
			<li> A rough estimate of the effects of the closure on the different neighborhoods and ideas (for example: an estimate of how many riders will be displaced in your neighborhood), and
			<li> A paragraph outlining what services (e.g. additional buses, ferries, bikes, temporary road reconfigurations or restrictions) your neighborhoods would need to mitigate the effects.

	<li > <b>HC 12: Catchments for L-Train Stations</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 18 November</b>  <br>


      <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> divides a region based on the distance to a set of input points.  This simple idea has many applications, one of the most famous was the <a href="http://johnsnowbicentenary.lshtm.ac.uk/about-john-snow/">work of John Snow</a> to study the 1854 cholera outbreak.  Our focus will be on mapping access to public resources and transit.

      <p>The sample program builds a Voronoi diagram will be for libraries across the city (using the
      library data set from  <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Library/p4pf-fyc4">NYC Library Locations</a> (download as CSV file).
      Our map highlights the regions closest to each library:

      <p>
      <iframe src="../../seminar4/s17/libVor.html" style="width: 95%; height: 700px" name="internal"></iframe>

      <p>To make our map, we
      <ol>
      	<li> First take library locations and calculate the Voronoi diagram (using the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html">scipy</a> package).
      	<li> While going row by row to get the library locations, add markers to the map (we're adding them as separate markers, not a MarkerCluster, since we don't want them to collapse when zooming out).
      	<li> Show the plot in a matplotlib window to make sure its working (note:  if you have a separate matplotlib window you may need to close it, since the rest of the program is waiting until it's done to continue).
      	<li> Then write out the locations as a geojson file (using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson">geojson</a>).
      	<li> Load the regions in as a geoJSON layer in folium.

      </ol>

      <p>If you are using anaconda (either spyder, idle3, or jupyter), the scipy and matplotlib packages are included.  To install geojson, type at a terminal window:
      <pre>
      	pip install geojson
      </pre>

      <p> The program, <a href="../../seminar4/s17/makeVor.py">makeVor.py</a>, is a bit rambling, but contains all the steps above (a better design would be to split into separate functions or files for the different tasks).  Try running it on the library dataset (assumes that it is in the same folder as the program).

      <p>Note that it does very well in dense regions but has odd behavior on the edges of the map since we didn't include in the <tt>.json</tt> file any point at infinity and didn't clip the maps to the city boundaries.

      <p>Modify the program to make to make two Voronoi diagrams:
      <ul>
      	<li> Make a Voronoi diagram of the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49">NYC subway stations</a>
          (download as CSV).  (Despite the name of the file suggesting that it's from 2010, the file contains the new Second Avenue Subway stops).
        <li> Make a Voronoi diagram of the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49">NYC subway stations</a>
            <b>without the L-train stations that east of the tunnel</b> in the input file.
      </ul>

		<p> Submit a .pdf file with a screen capture image of your first HTML map (with all subway stations) and your second HTML map (without L-train stations east of the tunnel).  For each map, center the view on your station.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 13: Project Webpage</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 25 November</b>  <br>

		<p> Submit the URL of your group presentation (the two slides for the presentation)  as part of a .pdf file.  If you have plans to add more to the website, include in the .pdf file any changes you have planned but didn't have a chance to enter yet.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 14: Draft Presentations</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 2 December</b>  <br>

		<p> Submit the slides of your group presentation (two slides) as  a .pdf file.  Your slides should include who is on the team, the neighborhood you chose, and a brief description of your solution to how much additional housing, and what additional services would be needed.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 15: Feedback Forms</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 6 December</b>  <br>

        <p><img height=300 src="csci127HonorsF18.jpg">

		<p> (This is included for completeness, since the forms will be passed out and returned in section on 5 December.  After you have commented on others group presentations, we will distribute the forms, so that groups can use these to improve their slides and webpages for the final presentation the following week. )
