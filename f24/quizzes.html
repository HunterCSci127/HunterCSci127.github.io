  Each week, there will be a paper quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and online lab exercises.
  <ul>
  	<li> Quiz questions will cover the topics from lectures, labs, and homeworks.
  	<li> Quizzes are offered on weekdays, 11:30 am to 5 pm in lab 1001G HN.  You must make an appointment to take the quiz. 
  	<li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
  	<li> The quizzes are on paper, and you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
  </ul>

  <h3>Code Reviews</h3>

  </h4>
  <p>
  There will also be weekly walk-throughs ("code reviews") where you explain one of the programs you wrote for homework to a teaching assistant.  Code reviews are integral to software design and development: explaining your coding decisions and convincing another it works correctly leads to improvements in the design and lessens unexpected behaviors and errors.

  <ul>
  	<li> Code reviews are offered on weekdays, 11:30 am to 5 pm in lab 1001G HN.  You must make an appointment to do your code review.
  	<li> Each week focuses on several programs (see below). You can choose which program you would like to explain.
  	<li> After you choose a program, the teaching assistant will guide you through the code review.
  	<li> If something is unclear or you are stuck, ask questions!  Having a two-way conversation about the concepts, the code, and the design are highly encouraged.
  	<li> <b>There are no make-up code reviews.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing code review grades (the final exam will also replace the grade when you take it but do better on the final exam).
