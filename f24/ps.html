<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: September 1, 2024
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 5PM</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help at in-person tutoring. Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture Notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

	<p>Write a program that draws an Octagon using the <tt>turtle</tt> library.
    <br><img id="octagon" alt="program 2" src="../images/quiz2A.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

	<li > <b>Due Date: October 23</b> <b style="float:right"> Reading: <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a></b><br>

		<p>Following  <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>, write a program that asks the user for the name of a png file and print the number of pixels that are nearly white (the fraction of red, the fraction of green, and the fraction of blue are all above 0.75).

		<p>For example, if your file was of the snow pack in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California in September 2014:

		<p>
		<img src="../images/CaliforniaDrought_02232014_md.jpg" width=300>

		<p> then a sample run would be:
		<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter file name:  caDrought2014.png
Snow count is 38010</pre>

		<p> Note:  for this program, you only need to compute the snow count.  Showing the image will confuse the grading script, since it's only expecting the snow count.
</li>

<!--problem 19-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: October 28</b> <b style="float:right"> Reading: <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a> and <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a></b><br>

	<p>We can store DNA sequences as strings. These strings are made up of the letters A, C, G, and T. For a given DNA string, the GC-content is the percent of the string that is C or G, written as a decimal.</p>
	
	<p> Write a program that prompts the user for a DNA string, and then prints the length and GC-content of that string.</p>

	<p>A sample run of the program: </p>
	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a DNA string:  ACGCCCGGGATG
Length is 12
GC-content is 0.75
</pre>

	<p><i>Hint:</i> You can use a <tt>for</tt>-loop to go through each character in the string, and count each time you encounter a 'C' or 'G'. You can use an <tt>if</tt>-statment to check what kind of character the loop is currently on. Alternatively, you can use the <tt>count()</tt> method introduced in Lab 2 to get the total occurrences of 'C' and 'G' in the string.

      <li > <b>Due Date: November 4</b>  <b style="float:right"> Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">Chapter 4</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Selection/ConditionalExecutionBinarySelection.html">Section 7.4</a></b>

        <p>The program <a href="../files/turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward 50 steps
          <li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
          <li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
          <li> '^':  lifts the pen
          <li> 'v':  lowers the pen
        </ul>
        For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.

        <p>
        Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
        <ul>
          <li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards 50 steps
          <li> 'S':  makes the turtle stamp
          <li> 'l':  turns the turle 45 degrees to the left
          <li> 'r':  turns the turtle 45 degrees to the right
          <li> 'p':  change the pen color to purple

<p> Write a program that asks the user for a name of an image <tt>.png</tt> file and the name of an output file. Your program should create a new image that has only the blue channel of the original image (that is, no green channel).</p>

<p>A sample run of your program should look like:</p>

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter name of the input file:  csBridge.png
Enter name of the output file:  blueH.png
</pre>

<p>Sample input and resulting output files:</p>

<p>
<img src="../files/csBridge.png" width="300">
<img src="../files/blueH.png" width="300">
</p>

<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <tt>plt.show()</tt> and <tt>plt.imshow()</tt> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.</p>

	In Lecture 3, we wrote a program to make a Hunter logo 'H' on a 10x10 grid.   Write a program that creates a 'C' logo for CUNY on a 30x30 grid.

	</p><p>
	<img src="../files/blueC.png" style="padding:5px" height="200">

	</p><p> The grading script is expecting:
	</p><ul>
		<li> The file to be saved as:  <tt>logo.png</tt>.
		</li><li> The grid to be 30 x 30.
		</li><li> The 'C' to be 0% red, 0% green, and 100% blue.  The upper part of the 'C' should be the top third of the image; the left part of the 'C' should be the left third of the image; and the lower part of the 'C' should be the the bottom third of the image.
		</li><li> The remaining pixels in the image should be white (100% red, 100% green, and 100% blue).
	</li></ul>

	<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).

	<p>Modify the flood map of NYC from <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> to color the region of the map with elevation greater than 6 feet and less than or equal 20 feet above sea level the color grey (50% red, 50% green, and 50% blue).

		</p><p> Your resulting map should look like:
