<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: September 1, 2024
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 5PM</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help at in-person tutoring. Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture Notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

	<li> <b>Due Date: September 11</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

	<p>Write a program that draws an Octagon using the <tt>turtle</tt> library.
    <br><img id="octagon" alt="program 2" src="../images/quiz2A.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".
	</i>

      <br><i>(The cipher disk above shifts 'A' to 'N', 'B' to 'O', ... 'Z' to 'M', or a shift of 13.  From <a href="http://www.secretcodebreaker.com/history2.html">secretcodebreaker.com</a>.)</i>


		<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then prints out the word with each letter <b>shifted right</b> by 13.  That is, 'a' becomes 'n', 'b' becomes 'o', ... 'y' becomes 'l', and 'z' becomes 'm'.

		<p>Assume that all inputted words are in lower case letters:  'a',...,'z'.

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a word: zebra
Your word in code is:
mroen
</pre>

<p>Hint: You can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/mtlynch3/46092b904d43af05c4e2e71242670bde">this file</a> to get started with this assignment.</p>

<!--problem 16-->
<li> <b>Due Date: October 16</b><b style="float:right"> Reading: <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a></b><br>
 
 <p>Write a program that converts kilometers to miles. Your program should prompt the user for the number of kilometers and then print out the number of miles.</p>

<p><b>A useful formula: miles = 0.621371*kilometers.</b></p>

</li>

<!--problem 17-->
<li> <b>Due Date: October 22</b><b style="float:right"> Reading: <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a></b><br>

	<p>Write a program that implements the pseudocode below:
<pre>
1.  Ask the user for the number of hours until the weekend.
2.  Print out the days until the weekend (days = hours // 24)
3.  Print out the leftover hours (leftover = hours % 24)
</pre>

<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter number of hours:  27
Days: 1
Hours: 3
</pre>

<p>and another sample run:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter number of hours:  52
Days: 2
Hours: 4
</pre>


		<p><i>Hint: See <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/OperatorsandOperands.html">Section 2.7</a>.</i>

<!--problem 18-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: October 23</b> <b style="float:right"> Reading: <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a></b><br>

		<p>Following  <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>, write a program that asks the user for the name of a png file and print the number of pixels that are nearly white (the fraction of red, the fraction of green, and the fraction of blue are all above 0.75).

		<p>For example, if your file was of the snow pack in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California in September 2014:

		<p>
		<img src="../images/CaliforniaDrought_02232014_md.jpg" width=300>

		<p> then a sample run would be:
		<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter file name:  caDrought2014.png
Snow count is 38010</pre>

		<p> Note:  for this program, you only need to compute the snow count.  Showing the image will confuse the grading script, since it's only expecting the snow count.
</li>

<!--problem 19-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: October 28</b> <b style="float:right"> Reading: <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a> and <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a></b><br>

	<p>We can store DNA sequences as strings. These strings are made up of the letters A, C, G, and T. For a given DNA string, the GC-content is the percent of the string that is C or G, written as a decimal.</p>
	
	<p> Write a program that prompts the user for a DNA string, and then prints the length and GC-content of that string.</p>

	<p>A sample run of the program: </p>
	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a DNA string:  ACGCCCGGGATG
Length is 12
GC-content is 0.75
</pre>

	<p><i>Hint:</i> You can use a <tt>for</tt>-loop to go through each character in the string, and count each time you encounter a 'C' or 'G'. You can use an <tt>if</tt>-statment to check what kind of character the loop is currently on. Alternatively, you can use the <tt>count()</tt> method introduced in Lab 2 to get the total occurrences of 'C' and 'G' in the string.
