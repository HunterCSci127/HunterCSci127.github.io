<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: September 1, 2024
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 5PM</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help at in-person tutoring. Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture Notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

<h2>Programming Exercises</h2>
<!--problem 1-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: September 10</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

	<p>	Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

<!--problem 2-->
	<li> <b>Due Date: September 11</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

	<p>Write a program that draws an Octagon using the <tt>turtle</tt> library.
    <br><img id="octagon" alt="program 2" src="../images/quiz2A.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".
	</i>

<!--problem 3-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: September 12</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

    <p>Write a program that implements the pseudocode ("informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm") below:</p>

     <pre>
        <code>
          Repeat 36 times: 
            Walk forward 100 steps
            Turn left 145 degrees 
            Walk forward 10 steps 
            Turn right 90 degrees 
            Walk forward 10 steps 
            Turn left 135 degrees 
    	    Walk forward 100 steps 
         </code>
      </pre>

     The result should look as follows:
  <p>

	<li > <b>Due Date: September 13</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>


		<p>Write a program that will print "I love Python!" 25 times.

		<p>The output of your program should be:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!

</pre>

<!--problem 5-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: September 16</b> <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that uses the <tt>turtle</tt> library to draw a 5-pointed star.

		<p>Your output should look like this:
		<br>
		<img height = 150 src="../images/star.png">

		<p><i>Hint: To draw the 5-pointed star, the turtle must turn a total of 720 degrees.  How many degrees does the turtle need to turn at each point?</i>

<!--problem 6-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: September 17</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS
	<a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/TherangeFunction.html">Section 4.7</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that prints out the numbers from 2 to 17.


		<p>The output of your program should be:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:200px">2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
</pre>

<!--problem 7-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: September 24</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="lab2.html"> Lab 2 </a></b><br>

		<p>Using the string commands introduced in <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, write a Python program that prompts the user for a message, and then prints the message, the message in upper case letters, and the message in lower case letters.

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:420px">
Enter a message:  Mihi cura futuri
Mihi cura futuri
MIHI CURA FUTURI
mihi cura futuri
</pre>

		<p>Another run:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a message:  I love Python!
I love Python!
I LOVE PYTHON!
i love python!
</pre>

	<p><i>Hint:  Your program should be able to take any phrase the user enters and prints it, it in upper case letters, and it in lower case letters.  To do that, you need to store the phrase in a variable and print variations of the stored variable.
	</i>

<!--problem 8-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: September 26</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="lab2.html"> Lab 2 </a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a phrase and then prints out the ASCII code of each character in the phrase.

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a phrase:  I love Python!
In ASCII:
73
32
108
111
118
101
32
80
121
116
104
111
110
33
</pre>

<p>And another sample run:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a phrase: ABC
In ASCII:
65
66
67
</pre>



		<p><i>Hint:  If <tt>c</tt> is a character, <tt>ord(c)</tt> returns its ASCII code.  For example, if <tt>c</tt> is 'I', then <tt>ord(c)</tt> returns 73.  See <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.</i>
