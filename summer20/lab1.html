<h2>Lab 1<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Summer 2020<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will focus on using the Gradescope system and simple programs
in Python.

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and Python IDLE programming
environment.




</div>


<div>
<h3>Using Blackboard</h3>

<p>This course will use the on-line Blackboard system for course announcements, lecture previews, and posting grades.  Blackboard should be accessible
through your CUNY First account (see Hunter <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/blackboard/blackboard-information-page">ICIT Blackboard page</a> for directions on using the system and how to get help).
The lecture previews can be found under the <tt>Content</tt>
menu (left hand side of <tt>Home</tt> screen).

<!--
<p>
<b>Chrome:</b> There were known bugs using the previous version of Blackboard with the Chrome browser.  In particular, the Chrome browser often would freeze during quizzes.  These have reportedly been fixed in the new version.
</p>


<p>
<b>Timing Out:</b> If the system times out and locks your attempt (happens rarely when the browser or PC crashes), contact the instructor so they
can clear the attempt so you can try again.
</p>
-->
</div>

<div>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>

Each week on Gradescope, there is an <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  This week, we will have a quiz on the academic integrity policy of City University of New York. See the <a href="quizzes.html">topics and deadlines</a> for information about future quizzes and code reviews.

</div>

<div>
<h3>Using Python</h3>

<p>We will be using the <tt>IDLE</tt> programming environment for Python, since it is very simple and comes with all distributions of Python (if you would prefer to use another programming environment, <tt>Spyder</tt> is loaded on the lab machines).

<p>To launch <tt>IDLE</tt>:
<p><b>Note:</b><i> The following assumes you are working on one of our lab laptops (you can check out a laptop to work on in lab 1001E Hunter North) running the Ubuntu Linux distribution. If you are running another Unix-like operating system such as a different Linux distribution or MacOS, locate the <b>terminal</b> on your machine. If you are running on Windows, you can find instructions on how to obtain a Linux terminal on your computer at the bottom of <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/summer20/lab3.html">Lab3.</a> Instructions on how to install Python on your computer are provided at the bottom of this page.</i>

<ul>
	<li> Click the icon on the left for the <b>terminal</b>. It will launch a terminal window in which you can type commands.
	<li> In the terminal window, type:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">idle</pre>
	(followed by an enter/return).

	<li> A new window will launch for <tt>IDLE</tt>.


	<li> To see that it works, type at the <tt>IDLE</tt> prompt:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
print("Hello, World!")
</pre>

</ul>


<p>
Instead of using the shell window (where we can try things immediately), let's use a text window, where we can save our program for later and submit it to Gradescope (this is the basis of the first program).

<ol>
	<li> First, open up a text window:  on the menu bar, choose "File" and from that menu, choose "New File"<!-- (you can also type "&#8984;N")-->.
	<li> In that window, type:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
#Name:  ...your name here...
#Email:  ...your email here...
#Date: August 27, 2018
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>
	<li> Save the program (using the "Save" under the "File" menu). When you save it, name it something that you will be remember for the future and end it in <tt>.py</tt>.  For example, <tt>ps1.py</tt>.  At the end of lab, save your programs to a USB drive, DropBox, or mail them to yourself.
	<li> Run your program (using the "Run Module" from the "Run" menu).
	<li> If it prints "Hello, World!" to the screen, then log into Gradescope (see notes below):
	<ul>
		<li> On the left hand menu, choose "Assignments".
		<li> From the list, choose "1. Hello, World!".
		<lik> In the file upload, drag over the <tt>.py</tt> file you just created and ran, and
		<li> click "Submit".
	</ul>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Using Gradescope</h3>

<p>This course will use the on-line <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a> system for submitting
work electronically.  An email invitation to the course was sent to your email address (we used the one saved for you on Blackboard).  If you did not receive the email, one of the teaching staff can regenerate it for you.

<ul>
	<li> Open your email and click the links to set up your account.
	<li> Once you have your account, click on the "Assignments" menu (left hand side of window), and then choose the assignment "1.  Hello, World."
	<li> Drag and drop your program onto the submit box.
	<li> Click on confirmation button to submit your program.  You will see a pop-up box confirming that the program was uploaded.
	<li> In 30 to 60 seconds, the gradescope page will have your results (remember to put your name on the top of the file for full credit!).
	<li> Each program can be submitted multiple times up to the deadline.
</ul>

<h3>More Python:  Turtles</h3>

<p> Now that you have just submitted your first program, let's try some other Python commands.  Here's a quick demo (click the triangle to run the program):
<p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/22709f8349" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
A quick overview of the above program:
<ul>
	<li> Lines that begin with <tt>#</tt> are ignored by Python-- they are comments for you to remember what you did and others to follow what's going on.
	<li> The line <tt>import turtle</tt> loads in the built-in turtle graphics drawing package.  It's part of all versions of Python but, to keep programs small, is not included unless you explicitly import it.  In addition to built-in packages, there are many others that have been written to make Python more useful.  We will use both kinds as the semester progresses.
	<li>  The line <tt>tia = turtle.Turtle()</tt> creates a turtle object called <tt>tia</tt> (you can call your turtles almost any combination of letters (and underscores and numbers)-- we used a name starting with "t" since turtle starts with "t").
	<li> The next line:  <tt>for i in range(4):</tt> is the first part of a for-loop that will repeat the commands indented beneath it 4 times.
	<li> The turtle class has many functions that you can use for your turtle.  The next two lines demonstrate two of them:
	<ul>
	    <li> <tt>tia.forward(150)</tt> moves <tt>tia</tt> forward 150 steps.
    	<li> <tt>tia.right(90)</tt> turns <tt>tia</tt> to the right 90 degrees.
    </ul>
</ul>


<p>Now, let's write the same program in <tt>IDLE</tt>:
<ol>
	<li>  Open up a new file window in <tt>IDLE</tt> ("File > New File").
	<li> Type (or copy) into your window:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
import turtle
tia = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(4):
    tia.forward(150)
    tia.right(90)
</pre>
	<li> Save your program ("File > Save"). <br>
	<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".</i>
	<li> Run your program (using the "Run Module" from the "Run" menu).
	<li> Change your program so that it draws a decagon (10-sided polygon).
	<li> Test your program and modify until you have a decagon.  When you do, add comments at the top of your program:
<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:400px">
#Name:  ...your name here...
#Email: ...your email here...
#Date: August 25, 2017
#This program draws a decagon.
	</pre>
	Run your program after editing to make sure you do not have any typos.
	<li> Log into Gradescope (see notes above).  On the left hand menu, choose "Assignments".  From the list, choose "2. Decagon".
	In the file upload, drag the <tt>.py</tt> file you just created and ran, and click "Submit".

</ol>

<h3>More Turtle Commands</h3>

<p>To review, we introduced the turtle commands:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>forward()</tt>
	<li> <tt>left()</tt>
	<li> <tt>right()</tt>
</ul>
as well as importing the turtle package (<tt>import turtle</tt>) and creating ("instantiating") a turtle (<tt>thomasH = turtle.Turtle()</tt>).

<p>There are many more turtles commands.  Over the next couple of classes, we will use those in the <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">turtle chapter</a> from the textbook.  In addition to the ones that control movement, you can also change the color of the turtle, change the size of the drawing pen, and change the backbround color (by making a window or screen object, and changing it's color):
