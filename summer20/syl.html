Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2020<br><br>
</h3>
</div>


<div>
<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>  <b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i>
This course presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on problem-solving and computational thinking through 'coding': computer programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS minor. MATH 12500 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-req for intended Majors.

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience.
Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the online Labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.
<!--Students should review topics from
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.-->

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.

<p><b>Course Format:</b> This course is taught in condensed format with in-class meetings twice a week and online activities.  Each time the course meets:
<ul>
	<li> 1.5 hours of lecture,
	<li> 0.5 hours of in-person assessment (quizzes), and
	<li> 1.0 hours of <b>Online Labs to be completed by the students independently</b> (links to the labs can be found in the <a href="../s20.html">Course Outline</a>).
</ul>




<p><b>Lecture Participation:</b> At every lecture, attendance will be taken.  Students who arrive on time and stay for the duration of the class will receive full credit.  Attendance will only help your grade. If you miss a class, your grade on the final exam will replace that grade.



<p><b>Quizzes:</b> Every class, there will be an quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory exercises.
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
	<li> All quizzes must be taken in class.
	<li> There are no make-up quizzes. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
	<li> Quizzes are on Gradescope (echoing the style of the final exam).
	<li> For the quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
	<li> Quizzes are offered immediately following the lecture of each class meeting.
		</ul>
</ul>


<p><b>Laboratory Exercises:</b> Each week, you are expected to work through the associated lab exercise.  The on-line labs are available on the course webpage can be completed in the lab or at home (you will need a computer with Python and Unix shell, and as the term goes on, C++).

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually three classes before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and lab.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must
perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted by <b>9:30a deadline</b>.
Programs are submitted via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>.
You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores).
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>


<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  Sample and past exams are available on the course webpage. A mock exam will be available on Gradescope the week before the final.
<b>You must take and pass the final to pass the course.</b>

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 30%. </li>
      <li>Quizzes: up to 30% (if you miss a quiz, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that  quiz grade).</li>
      <li>Attendance: up to 10% (if you miss a class, your grade on the final will replace that participation grade).</li>
      <li>Final Exam: 	30% (up to 70% if you do better on the final exam than on quizzes and do not recieve full attendance credit). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<!--
<p>This is a <i>zero cost course</i>.  All textbook materials are freely available to enrolled students.
-->

<p><b>Textbook & Readings:</b> The following free on-line book is required for the course:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Python 3)</a> (free on-line textbook).
</ul>
Additional readings and tutorials are available on the course webpage.

<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses multiple software tools and languages. 
<ul>
	<li> Python:  a programming language that is freely available across multiple platforms.  See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on obtaining it for your home computer.
	<li> Unix:  an operating system that underlies Ubuntu Linux as well as MacIntosh OSX.
	<li> Blackboard:  the learning management system used throughout CUNY.  Accounts are provided automatically to all enrolled students. 
	<li> Gradescope:  an automatic grading program from UC Berkeley.  All programming assignments, quizzes, and the final exam will be submitted to gradescope. An email with access information will be sent to your email of record on Blackboard two days before the semester starts.
	<li> Github: a freely available site for hosting and collaborating, particularly for programming.
	<li> C++: a programming language that is freely available.  We will use it

</ul>

<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.
