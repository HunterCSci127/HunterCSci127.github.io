<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: September 1, 2023
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6pm</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help at in-person tutoring, or on our online discussion board (Piazza). Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/f23/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>
