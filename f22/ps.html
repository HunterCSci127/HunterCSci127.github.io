<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: February 1, 2022
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6pm</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in Blackboard drop-in tutoring, Blackboard discussion board and by e-mail (<b><tt>cs127uta AT hunter.cuny.edu</tt></b>). Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s22/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (35% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

    <br><img id="dodecagon" alt="program 2" src="../images/dodecagon.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".
	</i>

	<p><i>Hint:  See the  <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s22/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</i>

<h3><u> Lecture 2 and Lab 2</u></h2>

<!--problem 6-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: 19 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">Chapter 2</a> and 
	and 
	<a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/TheforLoop.html">Section 4.4</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that prints out the numbers counts down from 12 to 1. Need to use repetition statement.

		<p>The output of your program should be:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:50px">
12
11
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3

WOW
</pre>

		<p><i>Hint: Use a loop and print out the index or loop variable.</i>


<!--problem 7-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: 20 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">Chapters 2</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Strings/toctree.html">Chapter 9</a></b><br>

		<p>Using the string commands introduced in <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, write a Python program that prompts the user for a full name in the format of first name first and last name last, separated by a space. Use split method of string to extract last name and first name, then change last name to upper case using upper method of string. Print the full name in the format of last name first, first name followed, separated by comma.

        Enter user name, change it to lower case letters, followed by "@hunter.cuny.edu".</p>

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:640px">
Enter name in format firstName lastName: John Smith
name in LASTNAME, firstName format: SMITH, John
Enter user name of email: Js216
email: js216@hunter.cuny.edu
</pre>

	<p><i>Hint:  Your program should be able to take any phrase the user enters and prints it, it in upper case letters, and it in lower case letters.  To do that, you need to store the phrase in a variable and print variations of the stored variable.
	</i></p>

<!--problem 8-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: 21 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">Chapters 2</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Strings/toctree.html">Chapter 9</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a phrase. Then for each character in the phrase, print out character, its ASCII code, and the next two letter in ASCII table.</p>

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:378px">
Enter a phrase: I love Python!
letter ASCII next_two_letter
     I    73               K
          32               "
     l   108               n
     o   111               q
     v   118               x
     e   101               g
          32               "
     P    80               R
     y   121               {
     t   116               v
     h   104               j
     o   111               q
     n   110               p
     !    33               #
</pre>

<p>And another sample run:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:378px">
Enter a phrase: ABC
letter ASCII next_two_letter
     A    65               C
     B    66               D
     C    67               E
</pre>


		<p><i>Hint:  If <tt>c</tt> is a character, <tt>ord(c)</tt> returns its ASCII code.  For example, if <tt>c</tt> is 'I', then <tt>ord(c)</tt> returns 73.  See <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.</i>
        <p><i>To right aligned the print out, use print("%6c %5i %15c"%(<tt>character, ASCII_code_of_character, next_two_letter_of_character</tt>)). You need to find out expression to represent character, ASCII_code_of_character, and next_two_letter_of_character.</i></p>

    <p>Explanation: 
    Use 6c since column header "letter" has 6 letters, c means character, for example, letter 'I' in string "I love Python!".   
    Use 5i since column header "ASCII" has 5 letters, i means int, which is the ASCII code of the current letter.
    Use 15c since column header "next_two_letter" has 15 letters, c means a letter, which is the next_two_letter of the current letter.</p>

      <br><i>(The cipher disk above shifts 'A' to 'N', 'B' to 'O', ... 'Z' to 'M', or a shift of 13.  From <a href="http://www.secretcodebreaker.com/history2.html">secretcodebreaker.com</a>.)</i>


		<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then prints out the word with each letter <b>shifted right</b> by 13.  That is, 'a' becomes 'n', 'b' becomes 'o', ... 'y' becomes 'l', and 'z' becomes 'm'.

		<p>Assume that all inputted words are in lower case letters:  'a',...,'z'.

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:516px">
Enter an all-small-letter string: zebra
Enter a non-negative int to shift: 13
ciphered string: mroen
</pre>

		<p>Here is another sample run of your program.

-->

<!--problem 14-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: 3 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">Chapters 2</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">4</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that asks the user for a name of an image .png file and the name of an output file.  Your program should create a new image that sets red channel of the original image to be zero.


		<p> A sample run of your program should look like:

<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:450px">
Enter name of the input file:  csBridge.png
Enter name of the output file:  csBridge_wo_red.png
</pre>

<p> Sample input and resulting output files:

<p>
<img src="../images/csBridge.png" width = 300>
<img src="../images/cyanBridge.png" width = 300>

<p>As another example, run the above program on shades of purple in a white background, as in the original figure shown in the left. Since purple is combination of red and blue, after setting red channel to be zero, which equals to remove red, the color of shades becomes blue in the modified figure, shown in the right. 

<p>In the original figure, background white is combined of 100% red, 100% blue, and 100% green. After removing red channel, the background has only blue and green, which changes to cyan color in the modified figure. 

<p>In the original figure, black color is combined of 0% red, 0% blue, and 0% green. After removing red channel, black color is still the same in the modified figure.  

<p> Sample input and resulting output files:

<p>
<img src="../images/shadesOfPurple.png" width = 300>
<img src="../images/shadesOfPurple_wo_red.png" width = 300>

	<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <tt>plt.show()</tt> and <tt>plt.imshow()</tt> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.

		<p> <i>Hint:  See <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>.</i>

<!--problem 15-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: 6 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">Chapter 2</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/MoreAboutIteration/Theforlooprevisited.html">Section 8.2</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that asks the user for a message and then prints the message out, one fewer word a line until there is only one word, then continue to add one word a line until becoming the original message.

<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a phrase: how are you?
how are you?
how are
how
how are
how are you?
</pre>

		<p> <i>Hint:  See <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a> or Lecture 2 notes.</i>

Use split method to break the original message by a a list of words. Then use for-loop to display partial of the list. To display a list of words as a string, use ' '.join(list_of_words). For example,

<pre>
lst = ['a', 'bc', 'd', 'e']
print(' '.join(lst[:2])) 
#display the first 2 elements of lst, joined by a space, 
#that is, display
#a bc

		<p>Create a program that creates a image of vertical blue and green stripes.  Your program should ask the user for the size of your image, the name of the output file, and create a <tt>.png</tt> file of stripes.  For example, if the user enters 10, your program should create a 10x10 image, alternating between blue and green vertical stripes.

		<p>
	A sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter the size: 10
Enter output file: stripes10.png
</pre>
		<br>
		<img src="../images/blue_green_stripes_10.png" style="padding:5px" height=200>

	<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <tt>plt.show()</tt> and <tt>plt.imshow()</tt> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.

<p>You may need to use the following information.
1 feet = 30.48 centimeters
1 inch = 2.54 centimeters

To round a decimal number <t>num</t> by 2 decimal numbers, use
round(<t>num</t>, 2).

To round <t>num</t> to a whole number, use round(<t>num</t>).

Test your code using <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/length/cm-to-feet-inch.html">cm to feet and inch</a>

<p>Write a program that implements the pseudocode below:
<pre>
(a) convert centimeters to feet
(b) convert centimeters to feet and inches
(c) convert feet and inches to centimeters
</pre>

<p>Some sample runs of your program should look like:

<p>Choose Option a.
When converting centimeters to feet, round the result to two decimal numbers after the decimal point.
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:550px">
(a) convert centimeters to feet
(b) convert centimeters to feet and inches
(c) convert feet and inches to centimeters
Enter a or b or c: a
Enter height in centimeters: 150
height is 4.92 feet
</pre>

<p>Choose Option b. Values of feet and inches are integers (whole numbers).
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:550px">
(a) convert centimeters to feet
(b) convert centimeters to feet and inches
(c) convert feet and inches to centimeters
Enter a or b or c: b
Enter height in centimeters: 150
height is 4 feet and 11 inches
</pre>

Hints for converting centimeters to feet and inches.
<ol>
   <li>Divide centimeters by 30.48, truncate decimal parts by int(<t>centimeters / 30.48</t>). That is the number of feet.</li>
   <li>Calculate the remaining, divide it by 2.54, get the whole number by int(<t>(centimeters - num_of_feet * 30.48) / 2.54</t>). That is number of inches.</li>
   <li>Optional: consider the possibility that number of inches is zero.</li>
</ol>

<p>Choose Option b and the resulting inch is zero. In this situation, display only feet, not inch.
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:550px">
(a) convert centimeters to feet
(b) convert centimeters to feet and inches
(c) convert feet and inches to centimeters
Enter a or b or c: b
Enter height in centimeters: 92 
height is 3 feet
</pre>

<p>Choose Option c. Round the centimeters to 1 decimal number. 
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:700px">

</pre>

In this task, take two inputs using
<pre>
feet_str, inches_str = input("Enter height in feet and inches, separated by a space: ").split()

#convert feet_str to an int using 
feet = int(feet_str) 
</pre>

<p>Choose an option other than a, b, or c.

  		<p> Write a program that asks the user for a list of words (separated by spaces), count number of words, and calculate those words ending with letter 'a' or 'b', then calculate its fraction rounded by two decimal numbers after the decimal point. Your program should output the total number of words and the fraction that end in 'a' or 'b'.  Assume that words are separated by spaces (and ignore the possibility of tabs and punctuation between words.)

  <p> A sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:500px">
Enter a list of words, separated by a space: apple banana cantalope durian shrub
number of words: 5
number of words ending with a or b: 2

Print out the number of words.  Make sure this works before going onto the next part.
  			<li> Next, count the number of words ending in 'a' or 'b' (hint:  find out the last letter of a word). Test that this part works before going on to the next step.

       <li>Next, ignoring the last word (which is a special case and can be dealt with separately), count the number of words ending in 'a' or 'b' (hint: count the number of "a " or "b "). Test that this part works before going on to the next step.

       <li>Last, check the last word to see if it ends in "a" or "b".

<a id="cr25"></a>
	<p> Logical gates can be used to do arithmetic on binary numbers.  For example, we can write a logical circuit whose output is one more than the inputted number.  Our inputs are <tt>in1</tt> and <tt>in2</tt> and the outputs are stored in <tt>out1</tt>, <tt>out2</tt>, and <tt>out3</tt>.

	<p>
	<img src="../images/add_1.png" height=250 ><br>

	<p>Here is a table of the inputs and outputs:

	<table border="1px">
	<tr>
	<th colspan=3>Inputs</th><th colspan=4>Outputs</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Decimal<br>Number</th><th>in1</th><th>in2</th><th>Decimal<br>Number</th><th>out1</th><th>out2</th><th>out3</th>

	</tr>
	</table>

Here is an analysis.
<ol>
   <li>When inputs are 00, 01, 10, 11, the expected output should be 01, 10, 11, 100, correspondingly. 
   <li>First, work on the least significant of output, out3. When input is 0<b>0</b>, 0<b>1</b>, 1<b>0</b>, 1<b>1</b>, the output should be 0<b>1</b>, 1<b>0</b>, 1<b>1</b>, 10<b>0</b>. The least significant digit of output, out3, is solely depending on the least significant digit of input in2. When in2 is 0, out3 is 1. When in2 is 1, out3 is 0. 
   <li>Next, work on the second digit of output, out2. Observe that when input is 01 or 10, output out2 is 1, otherwise, out2 is 0. Without loss of generality, check the case when input is 01, which means in1 is 0 and in2 is 1, that is, not in1 and in2.

   Equally, out2 is 1 when in1 and in2 are neither 00 nor 11. Use this approach, you can design a simpler circuit than our current one, with the same functionality.

   <li>Finally, work on the most significant digit of output, out1. Only when in1 and in2 are both 1, can out1 become 1.

  <p><iframe width="600px" height="400px" src="https://circuitverse.org/simulator/embed/add_1" id="projectPreview" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

  <br><b><i>Hints:</i></b> Create the same image shown above. Turtle should have a <b>pen size of 3</b> and  <b>move forward 100 steps in the direction it's facing initially before making a turn</b>.
  <br>This assignment aims to challenge you to analyze the image to deduce the process (given a description of the output, write the program to produce it), which is how software developers often approach problems.
  <br><b>So what should you do? </b>Try to puzzle out the image, break down what the turtle does, then apply what you have learned so far about definite loops (for loops) and turtle graphics to reproduce that process. Here some guiding questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How would you create one rhombus first if the wide angle is 45?
    <li>How many turtles do you see? How many repetitions? How many rhombuses do you need to draw?
    <li>What does the turtle do in each repetition?
    <li>What direction is the turtle facing before it stamps? Does it stamp before or after it turns?
    <li>Once you figured out the answer to the previous two questions, play around with the angle to produce the image.
    <li>Look up the turtle functions <tt>pencolor()</tt> and <tt>fillcolor()</tt> to produce the turtle colors?
    <li>You have used that background color before, what color was it?

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec" target="_blank">The parsec</a> is a unit of length used to measure the large distances to astronomical objects outside the Solar System, approximately equal to 3.26 light-years, i.e. 30.9 trillion kilometres (19.2 trillion miles).
      <p>For this program, you'll be doing a very common conversion: parsecs to light-years, and light-years to parsecs. You will use the formula: <i> 1 parsec = 3.26156 light-years</i>.

      <p>With this information, write a program that does the following:</p>
      <p>1. Asks the user which conversion they want to do:</p>
      <pre>
       enter 'a' for Light-Year to Parsec,
       enter 'b' for Parsec to Light-Year.
      </pre>
      <p>2. If the user enters the character 'a', the program will prompt for the number of lightyears to be converted and computes light-years to parsecs; if the user enters the character 'b' instead, the program will prompt for the number of parsecs to be converted and computes parsecs to light-years.</p>
      <p>3. Then the program will print the appropriate result.</p>
      <p>
          A sample run of your program should look like:
      <pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">

    Please enter the conversion you want to do:
    'a' for Light-Year to Parsec conversion
    'b' for Parsec to Light-Year conversion
    Your selection: a
    Please enter a number of Light-Years: 3
    3.0 Light-Years is equal to 0.919803 Parsecs.

    ### Another run of the program:

    Please enter the conversion you want to do:
    'a' for Light-Year to Parsec conversion
    'b' for Parsec to Light-Year conversion
    Your selection: b
    Please Enter a number of Parsecs: 1
    1.0 Parsecs is equal to 3.26156 Light-Years.

    ask the user for number of stamps
    create a turtle
    set colormode to 255
    set the turtle shape to 'circle'
    lift the turtle pen up

    repeat stamps times:
        stamp
        increment steps by 2
        if adding 3 to red, green, and blue does not exceed 255:
          add 3 to red, green, and blue
        set turtle to new color
        have turtle move forward by steps
        have turtle turn right 24 degrees

<p> Download the <a href="../files/ramenRatings.csv">Ramen dataset</a>, look at the data and, in particular, the column names.
<p> Then, write a program that:
<ul>
<li> Asks the user for the name of the input file.
<li> Prints the average rating, out of 5 stars, per serving style.
<li> Print the lowest rating for a ramen spot in Singapore, and the name of the place.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:500px">

  <p>

    <b>Let's explore another dataset!</b>
    <br>Consider the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings?select=scrubbed.csv" target="_blank">UFO dataset</a> NUFORC data by Sigmond Axel.
    <br>You can <a href="../files/UFO_sightings_US.csv">obtain the csv file directly here.</a>
    <br>First download and inspect the data by looking at the <b>column names</b> and type of data in each column.
    <p>
    Now modify the programs from <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a> that aggregates rainfall data and the program from <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> that plots shelter population to write a new program that:
    <ul>
    <li> Asks the user for the name of the input file.
    <li> Asks the user for the name of the output file.
    <li> Plots a bar plot of the 10 states in the dataframe with the longest average UFO sightings:
      <ul>
        <li> Use <tt>groupby()</tt> to aggregate the data by <tt>'state'</tt>, which in this dataset represents the state in which the UFO was seen, and average the <tt>'duration (seconds)'</tt> column.
        <li> Now sort the values with .sort_values(ascending=False)[:10] to get the top 10 states with the longest average UFO sighting (note, you'll notice that the averages are quite large, that is because this data contains some inconsistencies leading to a few records which report yearlong UFO sightings, etc.)</li>
        <li> Make a bar plot of the data grouped this way by using <tt>.plot.bar()</tt> on the grouped data
          <br> e.g. if you have

  In <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a>, we worked through a program that displayed the homeless shelter occupancy over time.  The same approach can be used for displaying any dataset where the date and time are stored.
	<p>For this program, use the csv file <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">superbowl.csv</a>. Export the file as CSV and save.


 <p> You can look at the program from <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> that displays shelter population over time to create a program that:
  <ul>
  <li> Asks the user to specify the input file,
  <li> Asks the user to specify the output file,

<p><b>Review from Lecture/Lab 4</b>

<p>
	You are a student attempting to take an Introduction to Computer Science course. Using what you have learned so far, you must finish this incomplete game titled <tt>Maze Runner</tt>. The objective of the game is, given the maze, the user must provide a string of commands that will navigate through the maze and reach the end. If the end is not reached, the game will restart from the beginning.
	The program, <tt>mazeRunner.py</tt> (available at:  <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127"target="_blank">
	https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127</a>) takes a string as input and uses that string to control where the user goes throughout the maze (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).
        <p><b>Your task:</b>
        <br>Implement the function <tt>playGame()</tt> to allow the user to use the following symbols:
        <ul>
          <li> 'R':  go Right of the current location
          <li> 'L':  go Left of the current location
          <li> 'U':  go Up from the current location
	  <li> 'D':  go Down from the current location
        </ul>

	<p>
	<tt>playGame()</tt> must first check, utilizing the other functions in the program, if each command (i.e. each character in the input string) is a valid move. Then update the location of the user (through the given variables <tt>'row'</tt> and <tt>'col'</tt>). If the user attempts to go through walls or simply does not reach the end of the maze after all of the commands have been executed,  <tt>PlayGame()</tt> returns false. If they reach the end (represented by an <tt>'X'</tt> at the location), it returns True.
	As per the display of the maze, each tile is represented by a 3x3 tile of special characters.
	<ul>
          <li> '*':  represents the wall tile
          <li> ' ':  represents a walkable tile
          <li> 'S':  represents the start tile
	  <li> 'X':  represents the end tile
	  <li> 'v':  represents the current location of the user
        </ul>

	<p>A sample run of the program using an example maze (which you can use for testing here: <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127"target="_blank">maze1.txt</a>)

Hello Everyone! Welcome to Maze Runner!
To succeed in this Computer Science class, you must go through some trials and tribulations...

      <p> Write three functions, <tt>setUp()</tt>, <tt>fractalRight()</tt>, and <tt>fractalLeft()</tt>.

      <p> Provided in the class <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">Github</a> is a template program, <tt>'turtleTree.py'</tt>. Starting from this template and using the pseudocode below (also included as comments in the template), implement your program as follows:</p>

      <pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:800px">

        setUp():
          Takes no parameters, and simply sets up the turtle, returning to caller.
          Here you should:
              1. Instiantiate the turtle,
              2. optionally hide the turtle (use .hideturtle())
              3. set the heading to 90 (which will face the turtle upwards)
              4. set the speed (t.speed(speed=0), you will want this)
              5. return the turtle to the calling function.

        fractalRight():
          Takes three parameters: a turtle t, distance 'distance', and i, the
          color value. This function does the following: if the distance is greater than 10,
          it will:
              1. Set the value of i to be i % 255,
              2. set the color of the turtle to be the value of i in the green channel (0,i,0)
              3. turn right 30 degrees
              4. move forward 'distance' steps
              5. stamp the turtle
              6. set the value of newDistance to distance-5
              7. call fractalRight with the parameters t, newDistance, i+25
              8. move backward by 'distance' steps, NOT newDistance,
              9. turn left 30 degrees
              10. call fractalLeft with parameters t, newDistance, i+25

        fractalLeft():
          This is pretty much the same as fractalRight, just to the left:
          Takes three parameters: a turtle t, distance 'distance', and i, the
          color value. This function does the following: if the distance is greater than 10,
          it will:
              1. Set the value of i to be i % 255,
              2. set the color of the turtle to be the value of i in the green channel (0,i,0)

              7. call fractalLeft with the parameters t, newDistance, i+25
              8. move backward by 'distance' steps, NOT newDistance,
              9. turn right 30 degrees
              10. call fractalRight with parameters t, newDistance, i+25

      </pre>

    <p> There is a subtle difference in the pseudocode of the two functions above, but it is very important and makes the difference between the two results. Observe the execution (hopefully by increasing the speed to save some time) and think about it!!!
      <p>Again, the template program, <tt>turtleTree.py</tt>, is available on the
      <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">CSci 127 repo on github</a>.
      The grading script does not run the whole program, but instead it tests your functions separately ('unit tests') to determine correctness.  As such, the function names must match exactly (else, the scripts cannot find it). Make sure to use the function names from the github program (it is expecting <tt>setUp()</tt>, <tt>fractalLeft()</tt> and <tt>fractalRight()</tt>).

<h2><u> Lecture / Lab 10</u></h2>




<li > <b>Due Date: 18 November</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/MoreAboutIteration/toctree.html">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> & <a href="lab10.html">Lab 10</a></b><br>

  <p> Write a program that asks the user for an integer input. Using input validation (while loop), check to see if the input is a perfect square. If it is not, continue asking the user to re-enter the input until it is a perfect square.

    <p>

      A perfect square is the product of an integer squared.
      Thus, a perfect square will have a whole integer root.
  <br>
      e.g. 4 is a perfect square because 2^2 = 4.
  <br>
      e.g. 16 is a perfect square because 4^2 = 16.

  <p>
    Your program will consist of three functions, but you only need to implement <tt>main()</tt>. The other two are provided in the template program <tt>perfectSquare.py</tt>, available on our <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">github repo.</a>
<p> The three functions are:
   <ul>
     <li> <tt>main()</tt> is responsible for obtaining <b>and validating</b> the input and printing the output. In order to validate the input, it will <b>repeatedly</b> ask for a number until a valid number is entered (a perfect square).
     <li> <tt>perfectSquareChecker()</tt> which, as the name suggests, will output whether or not the input integer is a perfect square.
     <li> <tt>is_square()</tt> the function used by <tt>perfectSquareChecker</tt> uses to check if a number is a square. It will return true if the input integer is a perfect square, and false otherwise.</li>
  </ul>


   <p> A template <tt>perfectSquare.py</tt> is available on our <a href="https://github.com/HunterCSci127/CSci127">github repo.</a> You must <b>fill in <tt>main()</tt></b> to implement its desired behavior.

  <p> A sample run of your program:
  <pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:600px">

  Enter a square integer: 12
  That is not a perfect square. Try again: -5
  That is not a perfect square. Try again: 123
  That is not a perfect square. Try again: 31
  That is not a perfect square. Try again: 21
  That is not a perfect square. Try again: 9
  This number is a perfect square. It is the product of 3.0 squared.
  </pre>

   <p>Note:  The grading scripts are expecting that your function is called <tt>perfectSquareChecker()</tt>.  You need to use that name, since in addition to running the entire program, the scripts are also "unit testing" the function-- that is, calling that function, in isolation, with different inputs to verify that it performs correctly.

    <p><i><b>Hint:</b>  See <a href="lab10.html">Lab 10</a> for an example of validating the input.</i>

	Write a program that creates a 10 by 10 image of a color of the users choice. Instead of simply asking the user for a color, the user will be creating the color by <b>iteratively increasing and decreasing</b> the <tt>rgb</tt> values until the user quits by entring 0 for each <tt>rgb</tt> value.
