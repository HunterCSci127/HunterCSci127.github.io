	<li > <b>HC 1:  Team Contract and Dataset (affordable house or another dataset of your choice)</b>  <b style="float:right">Due Date: 15 September</b>  <br>

    <!--
	<p>

    -->

	<p>  Throughout the semester, we will analyze the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr" target="_blank">Affordable Housing Production by Building dataset</a>,
which is generated by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), reporting on buildings, units, and projects that began after January 1, 2014 and are counted towards the Housing New York or Housing Our Neighbors plan. The Affordable Housing Production by Building file presents this data by building, and includes building-level data, such as house number, street name, BBL, and BIN for each building in a project.

   <h4>Step 1 -- Project structure:</h4>
    <p>We will work in teams. Each team will choose a borough to analyze. Each team member will then choose a neighborhood in that borough to report on.
    <br>Throughout the semester each team will provide different analyses of the overall borough supplemented by analyses of the chosen neighborhoods.
    <br>These analyses will be broken down across different assignments and will be summarized at the end of the semester in a showcase presentation.
    <p>We propose that you use the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr" target="_blank">Affordable Housing Production by Building dataset</a>. However, we give you the freedom to choose a different dataset if that would inspire you more. A great place to look for data is <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/" target="_blank">NYC Open Data.</a> If you choose a different dataset, it must have the following properties to guarantee that you will be able to fulfill all the assignments despite working with different data:
      <ul>
        <li> The data must have an attribute (column) corresponding to neighborhoods (preferably NYC)
        <li> It must include some numerical data
        <li> It must include some categorical data
        <li> It must include geographical locations (latitude and longitude columns, or exact address column)
      </ul>
and <b>must be approved by the instructor</b>.
<p>Discuss with your assigned team to decide on a dataset, then move on to Step 2. <br><i>Note: You don't need to identify the alternate dataset in this assignment, but if you are considering it you should indicate so in Step 2 and <b>must identify the dataset no later than our next meeting on September 16.</b></i>

<h4>Step 2 -- Team Contract:</h4>
 <p>Work with your assigned team to complete the <a href="../files/hcTeamContract_f22.pdf">Team Contract</a>.
<p>Once your contract is complete and signed by all team members, <b>upload a .pdf</b> to the assignment <tt>HC1</tt> in the honors section of <a href="http://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>. This will be a group submission (one submission per team). Unlike the Python code, it is not automatically graded.






	<hr>


  <li > <b>HC 2:  Neighborhood Analysis
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 15 September</b>  <br>

  <p>To begin, discuss with your team to pick a neighborhood in your team's borough (a different neighborhood for each team member). Keep in mind that you want all the neighborhoods together to be representative of the borough. You also want to be sure your neighborhood is well represented <a href="../files/Affordable_Housing_Production_by_Building.csv" target="_blank">in the dataset</a>.
  <p>Create a single page summary of your neighborhood that includes <b>at least</b> the following:
	<ul>
		<li> Name of the neighborhood (include in the title),
		<li> The zip code(s) of your neighborhood,
		<li> A map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted,
		<li> A photo or image that captures your neighborhood and
		<li> The demographics of your neighborhood.
	</ul>
Your summary should exceed these minimum requirements to receive full credit. Include in your summary any information you think will be relevant to the future analysis of your dataset (affortable housing in the area)
<br>A great resource for your analysis is <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/" target="_blank">Social Explorer</a>. <i>Note: you don't need to necessarily create an account. From the top menu, select <tt>Resources - Demographic Profiles</tt> and enter the zip code(s) of your neighborhood to find a wealth of information.</i>
  <p>Submit a .pdf file containing your summary.
  </p>



	<hr>
		<li > <b>HC 3:  Neighborhood Rankings
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 22 September</b>  <br>

  <p> Design a ranking for the most desirable features of a neighborhood.

  <p>There are multiple rankings of New York City Neighborhoods.  For example,
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/new-york-city-metro-area/">Niche</a>,

    <li> <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/ranking">DNA Info's rankings</a>,
    <li> <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/live/best-nyc-neighborhoods-for-college-grads-2016">Brick Underground</a>,
    <li><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/19/16329796/nyc-best-neighborhood-transit-walk-bike-score">Curbed's Walkable Neighborhoods</a>,
    <li> <a href="https://www.streetadvisor.com/search/cities-in-new-york-city-new-york">Street Advisor</a>
  </ul>


  With your group:
  <ul>
    <li> Assess what these rankings have in common and how they differ.
    <li> Which ranking do you favor and why?
    <li> What qualities make a neighborhood a desirable place for affordable housing?
    <li> Collate a list of the three most important.
    <li> How does each neighborhood in your team's borough fare according to this ranking?
  </ul>
  <p> You can share a Google Doc or you can use a collaboration tool for this project like <a href="https://miro.com/" target=blank>Miro</a> or <a href="https://padlet.com/" target=blank>Padlet</a>. Both have a free plan option that should be enough for the purpose of this project.
    <p> <b>Submission: </b> Submit a single .pdf file containing your assessment of the rankings and the three most desirable qualities, as well as a ranking of your team's borough (if all neighborhoods fare the same, you may indicate so and group the discussion to the borough).  You should use complete sentences, compare and contrast the rankings above and justify the three qualities that your group thought most important.
 This will be a group submission (one submission per team).
  </p>


<hr>
<li > <b>HC 4: Affordable Housing 
</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 29 September </b>  <br>


  <p>
    As rents raise, what obstacles did renters face?
    Is there anything specific to your neighborhood that made renting easier/harder?
    <br>With your group, browse the web to consider/research the topic.

    <p><b>Grading criteria:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Group identifies and discusses one or more obstacles, or argues that there were not any.
      <li> Group cites sources to support their argument.
      </ul>

  <p> <b>Submission: </b> Submit a one-page summary of your findings and cite your sources. This is a group submission (one submission per team).



	<hr>


		<li > <b>HC 5: Discussion
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 7 October IN LAB</b>  <br>

<p>In this meeting we will discuss your findings from <tt>HC 2</tt>, <tt>HC 3</tt> and <tt>HC 4</tt>. Each team will summarize the overall discussion of the borough and how that relates to the individual neighborhoods.
		<p>No submission necessary. This assignment will be graded based on your group's contribution to the discussion.
    <p>
      <br><b>Grading criteria:</b>
      <ul>
        <li> Group presents one particular characteristic of their borough from HC2, explains why it was chosen and indicates if individual neighborhood analyses aligned or differed on this particular finding.
        <li> Group presents the 3 neighborhood qualities chosen for HC3, explains why these were chosen and indicates if individual neighborhoods aligned or differed for this ranking.
        <li> Group succinctly presents their findings from HC4.
        <li> Group provides satisfactory summary in 5 minutes. Please coordinate with your group to do some preliminary planning for your presentation.
      </ul>
		</p>

  <li > <b>HC 6:  Highlighted Map
  </b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 12 October</b>  <br>


    <p><img src="../images/hunterSatMap.png" height = 300>
    <img src="../images/hiLight.png" height = 300>

    <p>
    For this program, we will create a highlighted map centered around your neighborhood, with a boxed region around a marker at the center of the neighborhood at full brightness, the region outside that box at 50% brightness.

    <p> To do this:
    <ul>
      <li> Create a .png file of a satellite map, centered on your neighborhood (Google maps works well for this, but you can use any mapping site to create your base map).
      <li> Write a Python program that reads in an image and saves the image to another file.  Run your program to make sure the reading and saving of an image works.
      <li> Set the upper region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  uses slices and see example in Lecture 3 and 4).  Run your program to make sure it has dimmed up the upper region and adjust to get the correct dimenssions.
      <li> Set the lower region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  think about what negative numbers mean as indices).  Run your program and fix any bugs.
      <li> Next, dim the side regions (hint:  think about what parts of the image have not been dimmed and change only those regions.)
      <li> Hints: png image downloaded has rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) value. The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque). See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20RGB%2C%20you,and%201.0%20(fully%20opaque).">explain of alpha channel</a> 
    </ul>

    <p> <b>Submission: </b> Submit your answer as a .pdf file (both code and image) to Gradescope.

<p>
  <li > <b>HC7:  Data Exploration
  </b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 14 October: IN LAB</b>  <br>

  <p>For this assignment, we will analyze our dataset 
  <a href="../files/Affordable_Housing_Production_by_Building.csv" target=blank>Affordable_Housing_Production_by_Building.csv</a>.
  This assignment will span over the course of two weeks (two meetings).
  <p> <b>During the first meeting</b>, on 14 October, look over <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zpRScvb5iGIcU8GwjSeP6BA_lhTLGLFq?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>this data-exploration document</b></a>, it will illustrate how to explore, clean and visualize the data.
  <br>This is an interactive computational environment (an Jupyter, a.k.a. ipython, notebook hosted in Google Colab). To execute each cell, one at a time, click on the play button or, with the cell highlighted, press Shift+Enter on your keyboard. The order in which you execute the cells matters. Start at the top, and work your way down the notebook, discuss it and make sure you understand it. Then make a plan together about what you will look for in the data and how.
  <p><b>Come to our next meeting </b>, on 21 October, with a clear plan, perhaps even a <i>working-in-progress program</i> (this is not a typo, it means a working program even if not final) and you will work as a team to refine your plan ( or your program) and produce the group analysis for the borough combining your ideas.
  <p> You will discuss your plan during the next meeting.
  <p> There are two parts to this analysis:
    <ul>
      <li>Group analysis of the borough and how it compares to others
      <li>Add some analysis of your individual neighborhoods

      </ul>


    <p><b>Grading Criteria</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzes the data to provide statistics for the neighborhood/borough and discusses these observations in writing (something like what you saw in the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zpRScvb5iGIcU8GwjSeP6BA_lhTLGLFq?usp=sharing" target="_blank">data-exploration document</a>) but you can simply report and discuss the stats, don't need to include the code. If you observe anything that seems anomalous don't hesitate to report so, data is never perfect! (meets: 2, exceeds:3)
        <li>Makes observations that go further what may be simply observed by using the <tt>describe()</tt> function. (meets:2, exceeds: 3)
        <li>Provides and discusses visualization for the data observed (at least 3 plots, more is better). These can be any type of plot, use what makes sense for your observations. Play and have fun with the data!!! Include the images and don't forget to discuss them!!! (meets:2, exceeds: 4)
        <li><b>Extra Credit:</b> Makes a connection between data analysis and observations made in HC2/HC3, in a paragraph and visually supported with plot(s). (5 points)
      </ul>


    <hr>
  <p>
    <li > <b>HC8  Finalize Data Analysis
    </b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 28 October</b>  <br>
    <p> During our meeting on October 21, discuss your analysis with your teammates, and decide on a plan for the group neighborhood analysis, keeping in mind the grading criteria below as a guide.
      <br> Make a plan on how to split the work for the group analyisis and how you will consolidate it into a unique submission.
      <br>

      <p> There will be one submission for each group, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Group analysis of the borough and how it compares to others
          <li>Some analysis of the individual neighborhoods
          </ul>

          <p><b>Grading Criteria (same for both submissions)</b>:
            <ul>
              <li>Analyzes the data to provide statistics for the neighborhood/borough and discusses these observations in writing (something like what you saw in the <a href="../files/HC7-HC8.html" target="_blank">data-analysis document</a>) but you can simply report and discuss the stats, don't need to include the code. If you observe anything that seems anomalous don't hesitate to report so, data is never perfect! (meets: 2, exceeds:3)
              <li>Makes observations that go further what may be simply observed by using the <tt>describe()</tt> function. (meets:2, exceeds: 3)
              <li>Provides and discusses visualization for the data observed (at least 3 plots, more is better). These can be any type of plot, use what makes sense for your observations. Play and have fun with the data!!! Include the images and don't forget to discuss them!!! (meets:2, exceeds: 4)
              <li><b>Extra Credit:</b> Makes a connection between data analysis and observations made in HC2/HC3, in a paragraph and visually supported with plot(s). (5 points)
            </ul>

            <p><b>What to submit</b>:
              <br>If you use Google Colab, you can print/save as pdf. and submit. Make sure every result (statistics and plots) is supported by a paragraph describing it. The paragraph should not only describe what you are doing (the code), but most importantly what you observe.
              <br>If you write a python program (.py) submit two files:
              <ul>
                <li>A report of your analysis including statistics and images supported by a discussion of waht you observed. Submit as a <tt>.pdf</tt> file.
                <li>A copy of your program as a <tt>.pdf</tt> file.
              </ul>

      <li > <b>HC9  Class Discussion and Feedback for Data Analysis + Revisions
      </b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 3 November</b>  <br>


      <p> <b>In class on October 29 each team will briefly present their data analysis</b> and other teams will provide feedback.
        <br> Each team will then <b>resubmit a revised data analysis</b> that addresses the feedback.


  <hr>
  <li > <b>HC 10:  Neighborhood  Map</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 10 November</b>  <br>


    <p> Using <tt>folium</tt>, generate an html map with markers for affordable housing in your neighborhood.
      <p><iframe src="../files/manhattan.html" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


    <p> To do so:
    <ul>
      <li> Create a neighborhood dataframe by selecting only the rows for your neighborhood
      <li> Create a map object
      <li> Loop for each row in the neighborhood dataframe to
        <ul>
          <li>create a marker for that latitude and longitude
            <li> add the marker to the map
        </ul>
      <li>Save the map to an html file
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Hint:</b> You can mirror the program in Lab9 that creates a map with markers for CUNY campuses.
    <p> <b>Note:</b> If your neighborhood has too many listings and the map is excessively crowded, you can select a random subset. Don't remove too many, however, so that the map remains representative of the data.

    <p> Submit a screenshot of your map and your code as a .pdf file.

  <hr>


  <li > <b>HC 11:  Webpage</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 17 November</b>  <br>

  <br>

    <p> We are going to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">github to make webpages</a> for your projects.  There will be only one site for each project, but we want everyone to set up their own neighborhood page the project webpage will link to.

    <p>Create a github page for your neighborhood.
    <ol>
      <li> If you haven't done so already, set up a repository for your neighborhood project (see the getting started tutorials from <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a> on how to set up a repository).
      <li> Follow through the <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">options for setting up a page</a> for your project (right under the "Ready to get started?" choose 'Project site').
      <li> Include on your neighborhood page:
        <ul>
          <li> the name of the neighborhood,
          <li> the highlighted map from HC6 as an image
          <li> the basic demographics & statistics from  HC 2
          <li> one paragraph summarizing your observations from HC3
          <li> a summary of your results from HC7 and HC8 along with plot images, and
          <li> the map from HC9 (embedded as iframe -- see below)
    </ol>

    <p>To embed an html as an <tt>iframe</tt> use the following html tag (assuming your map is called <tt>manhattan.html</tt> and it lives in the same directory as the page you want to embed it into)
    <br>
    <pre>
&lt;iframe src="manhattan.html" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>
    <br>If you are using markdown, you can insert html code by surrounding it with <tt>dl</tt> tags as in:
    <pre>
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;iframe src="manhattan.html" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>  Submit a .pdf file that contains the URL of your project on github (web address) and a screenshot of your project.
