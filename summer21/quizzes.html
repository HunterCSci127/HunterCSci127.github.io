<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>
Each week, there will be an paper quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory
exercises.
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
	<li> Quizzes are provided during class for a duration of 15 minutes. They will be administered on gradescope after lecture.
	<li> <b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
	<li> The quizzes are online, and you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
</ul>
