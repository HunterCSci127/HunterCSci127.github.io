<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: February 1, 2024
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6 PM</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help at in-person tutoring, or on our online discussion board (Piazza). Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

	<p>Write a program that draws an octagon. Use the sample turtle programs from class to get started.
    <br><img id="octagon" alt="program 2" src="../images/quiz2A.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

		<p>Using the string commands introduced in <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, write a Python program that prompts the user for a message, and then prints the message, the message in upper case letters, and the message in lower case letters.

		<p>Create a program that creates a image of purple and yellow stripes.  Your program should ask the user for the size of your image, the name of the output file, and create a <tt>.png</tt> file of stripes.  For example, if the user enters 50, your program should create a 50x50 image, alternating between purple and yellow stripes.

		<p>Following  <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>, write a program that asks the user for the name of a png file and print the number of pixels that are nearly white (the fraction of red, the fraction of green, and the fraction of blue are all above 0.75).

		<p>For example, if your file was of the snow pack in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California in September 2014:

		<p>
		<img src="../images/CaliforniaDrought_02232014_md.jpg" width=300>

		<p> then a sample run would be:
		<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter file name:  caDrought2014.png
Snow count is 38010</pre>

		<p> Note:  for this program, you only need to compute the snow count.  Showing the image will confuse the grading script, since it's only expecting the snow count.

	<a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Lists/StringsandLists.html">Section 10.25</a></b><br>

  		<p> Write a program that asks the user for a list of nouns (separated by spaces) and approximates the fraction that are plural by counting the fraction that end in "s".  Your program should output the total number of words and the fraction that end in "s".  Assume that words are separated by spaces (and ignore the possibility of tabs and punctuation between words.)

  <p> A sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter nouns: apple bananas cantalopes durian
Number of words:  4
Fraction of your list that is plural is 0.5
</pre>

  		<p> And another sample run of the program:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter nouns: hats gloves coats glasses scarves
Number of words:  5
Fraction of your list that is plural is 1.0
</pre>


  		<p><i>Hint:  Break this problem into pieces:</i>
  		<ol>
  			<li> First, count the number of words in the string the user entered (hint:  count the number of spaces).  Print out the number of words.  Make sure this works before going onto the next part.
  			<li> Next, ignoring the last word (which is a special case and can be dealt with separately), count the number of words ending in 's' (hint:  count the number of "s "). Test that this part works before going on to the next step.
  			<li> Last, check the last word to see if it ends in "s"-- since it's the last word, the "s" will always occur at the same index in the string.
  		</ol>

  		Implement (and test!) each part and then go on to the next.  See notes from Lecture 3.

        <p>The program <a href="../files/turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward 50 steps
          <li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
          <li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
          <li> '^':  lifts the pen
          <li> 'v':  lowers the pen
        </ul>
        For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.

        <p>
        Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
        <ul>
          <li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards 50 steps
          <li> 'S':  makes the turtle stamp
          <li> 'l':  turns the turle 45 degrees to the left
          <li> 'r':  turns the turtle 45 degrees to the right
          <li> 'p':  change the pen color to purple
        </ul>
