<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name, email and a brief description.

	<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:560px">
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Email: thomas.hunter1870@myhunter.cuny.edu
#Date: February 1, 2024
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")</pre>

  <li> You are strongly encouraged to submit your assignments before the due date.  Below lists the
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be
		<b>submitted before 6 PM</b> on the date due.
  <li> For flexibility (to allow you to catch up should you be unable to submit work on a particular day/week), due dates are staggered with one assignment due each day starting the second week of classes. <b>To succeed in this course you should work on assignments the week of the corresponding lab, don't work on an assignment the day it is due!</b>
     You don't know how long it will take you to debug a program and you will likely miss deadlines.
	<li> <b>No late assignments will be accepted. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help at in-person tutoring, or on our online discussion board (Piazza). Please take advantage of this, we offer a lot of support but you must be proactive about it.
  <li><b>You must always test your code locally (on your computer) before submitting to Gradescope.</b> When you run your program on your computer, if there is an error you will get compiler messages that will help you debug your code. You will not get that kind of feedback from Gradescope. When your program runs correctly on your computer, then you can submit.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, see <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab 1
</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and you did not type it, it is plagiarism.
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30% of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take more time. We suggest you study the week's Lecture notes and the Lab, then set aside a block of time to work on programming.  If you complete the programs for the week you are encouraged to work ahead on next week's batch.
  <li> If Gradescope gives you a "Test Failed: list index out of range" error or "The autograder failed to execute..." it means your program does not run. <b>Please check that your program runs correctly on your local machine before submitting to Gradescope.</b>

	<li > <b>Due Date: February 14</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/toctree.html">Chapters 1</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">2</a>; <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab1</a></b><br>

	<p>	Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

	<p><i>Hint:  See  <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</i>

<!--problem 2-->
	<li> <b>Due Date: February 15</b>  <b style="float:right"> Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">Chapter 4</a>; <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

	<p>Write a program that draws an octagon. Use the sample turtle programs from class to get started.
    <br><img id="octagon" alt="program 2" src="../images/quiz2A.png" width="250">
	<br><br>
	<i>Note:  Whenever submitting a turtle program, choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>.
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".
	</i>

	<p><i>Hint:  See  <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</i>

	<li > <b>Due Date: February 16</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">Chapter 4</a>; <a href="https://huntercsci127.github.io/s24/lab1.html">Lab 1</a></b><br>

    <p>Write a program that implements the pseudocode ("informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm") below:</p>

     <pre>
        <code>
          Repeat 36 times: 
            Walk forward 100 steps
            Turn left 145 degrees 
            Walk forward 10 steps 
            Turn right 90 degrees 
            Walk forward 10 steps 
            Turn left 135 degrees 
    	    Walk forward 100 steps 
         </code>
      </pre>

     The result should look as follows:

		<p>Write a program that will print "I love Python!" 25 times.

		<p>The output of your program should be:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!
I love Python!

		<p>Write a program that uses the turtle package to draw a 5-pointed star.

		<p>Your output should look like this:
		<br>
		<img height = 150 src="../images/star.png">

		<p><i>Hint: For the 5-pointed star, the turtle turns 2 complete revolutions (720 degrees).  How much does the turtle need to turn at each point?</i>

	& 
	<a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/TheforLoop.html">Section 4.4</a></b><br>

		<p>Write a program that prints out the numbers from 0 to 14.


		<p>The output of your program should be:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:200px">0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
</pre>


		<p><i>Hint: Use a loop and print out the index or loop variable.</i>

<!--problem 7-->
	<li > <b>Due Date: February 27</b>  <b style="float:right">Think CS: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html">Chapters 2</a> & <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Strings/toctree.html">Chapter 9</a></b><br>

		<p>Using the string commands introduced in <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, write a Python program that prompts the user for a message, and then prints the message, the message in upper case letters, and the message in lower case letters.

		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:420px">
Enter a message:  Mihi cura futuri
Mihi cura futuri
MIHI CURA FUTURI
mihi cura futuri
</pre>

		<p>Another run:
<pre style ="background-color:lavender;width:400px">
Enter a message:  I love Python!
I love Python!
I LOVE PYTHON!
i love python!
</pre>

	<p><i>Hint:  Your program should be able to take any phrase the user enters and prints it, it in upper case letters, and it in lower case letters.  To do that, you need to store the phrase in a variable and print variations of the stored variable.
